<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="410813">A well written, connected plot which will force you to rewatch it once you finish it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="478847">If you like a storyline where you can`t really be sure what`s going on until late in the plot, you`ll definitely enjoy this one. Cool art style, a nice break from Shounen. 

One of those animes that is at its best when you have no idea beforehand what it actually is about!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="505082">This show is deeply philosophical in nature. I know its a cheesy thing to say, but this anime really did change me as a human beeing.
Be prepared for really fast reading.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="497799">If you`re looking for a different kind of QUALITY ~ this is it! The graphic is kinda strange, creepy but cool! &amp; The plot ~ you won`t get it until you reach the middle to the end. However, that doesn`t mean this anime is not good, it`s Awesome! The plot flows and the ending gives you a big `WOW` in the face!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="287993">This anime is a very unique gem. A must see if you like meaningful stories.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="271953">Another masterpiece by Yuasa Masaaki.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="319358">Best anime of the decade for me.
A real master piece even surpassing Mind Game and Kaiba in my opinion.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="340500">Very unique, a little gem  waiting to be added to your collection</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="350281">Very philosophical and highly stylized state-of-the-art masterpiece. WATCH!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="378423">Intelligent, hilarious, impacting and unique. The art style is of particular taste, but is perfect for this kind of show. The story is very character-driven, so it`s a good thing that every bloody character in this show is awesome - all of them are highly memorable and likeable, and the voice acting is just excellent (assuming you can read quickly enough).
As well as having one of the most spectacular endings to a show I`ve ever seen, this is arguably the best series I`ve seen to date.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="505335">One of the best ends to an anime ever. An engaging learning experience about life and what it has to offer.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="312729">A really thought provoking show that got me thinking, what if I could go back and do things differently, would I? This is a real gem of a series, with romance at its core and can be enjoyed by all. As others have said, don`t be put off by the fast dialogue, it`s not that bad really. ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="164429">Intriguing, original illustration, and perfect OST. All in all an awesome and light-hearted anime. I cried in the end because it reflected my thoughts and how wrong I have been. Must watch for those looking for something deeper and artsy.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="331743">A unique, brilliant, deep and inspired piece of LIVING, exciting philosophy. It conveys that which concepts cannot, and does it in an extremely captivating way.

A very nice thing to those with experience in this field will be that it`s actually realistic, and chooses its` symbolism very wisely, always remaining spot-on despite not providing explicit  explanation for all of its` rich content. This makes for a very refreshing, engaging, living experience.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="564240">Its a slice of life comedy that is intelligent in conveying the message more mature, yet clever and its weird that makes sense in a wonderful way. The whole presentation it seems to be a bit of a difficult to appreciate at first. But still, it certainly takes effort to fully appreciate it. 

Overall it makes thinking about the story progression with formula temporal paradox (any situation in a time travel story turns out to permit many consistent solutions) and how it all come together.

This show is very worthwhile at conveying a powerful message to its audiences. There is a wonderfully an experience that feels that sure audiences can relate to. Its a clearly inspirational message morality, showing of college life`s failures and shortcomings as well as roughing, even though unfortunately its harsh with various trial here and there but leading up to the conclusion which is certainly made me personally infatuated.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="167">absolute masterpiece like all Yuasa Masaaki works.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="593963">this anime was like divine guidance for me! why?
i watched in the summer after my second year in college while thinking i could`ve had a better campus life!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="460147">Very cool, smart and enlightening - this series is of a high rewatching value. An anime I would reccomend to those who don`t watch anime, a must see for anime fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="315968">I`m positive there will be a lot of people who won`t enjoy watching this that much, due to being constantly bombarded with information, among other things. HOWEVER. It cannot be denied that this anime is pure brilliance, start to finish. The plot is cleverly crafted and planned, the pacing is perfect, and just about everything about it is original.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a novel by http://anidb.net/cr11105 [Morimi Tomihiko].
The story of The Tatami Galaxy follows an http://anidb.net/ch15129 [unnamed third year university student] in Kyoto, Japan and what he views as his wasted time in a particular club (also called circle) at his university. He meets http://anidb.net/ch15126 [Ozu], another student, whose encouragement sets him on a mission of dubious morality. He contemplates his affection for a second year engineering student, http://anidb.net/ch15127 [Akashi], and makes promises to her, usually of and within a romantic subtext. The culmination of his dubious missions often conflict with his interest in her in some way. The story is one of a number that draw on the author`s experience in Kyoto University.

<name>horny nosebleed</name>
<description>In Japanese media, healthy young men who have no other sexual outlet will often suffer nosebleeds upon seeing the naked female body, or even just a pair of well-filled panties.
The nosebleed is, of course, a visual shorthand/euphemism for sexual arousal. It is commonly interpreted that way for males and females, with little trickles of blood indicating mild arousal, and gushing fountains of blood indicating erection/extreme arousal in both sexes. It can also be interpreted as shorthand strictly for erections in males. In that case, when blood shoots from the nose explosively, and in ridiculous quantity, the implication would be an ejaculation.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Since college/university students are typically at least eighteen years old, with stories covering mature everyday life topics, you will find the college setting quite often in seinen and josei anime.
Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college. </description>

<description>Even though school clubs in Japan are not mandatory, there is some pressure from the social grid (e.g. fellow students, teachers) to participate in some kind of after-school activity, be it in sports or arts. Colleges also have clubs.
As a comedy element in anime, some students have joined too many clubs, and are thus constantly stressed out. There is also the element of social commentary, making it clear that you have to join a club, if you want to be part of the class. Since self-founded clubs need at least 3 members, the desperate search and advertising for new members can be cause for hilarity in anime.</description>

Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>Parallel universe/world or alternative reality is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we`ll use the term "Parallel Universe" which is more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own universe (meaning a fantasy world can just as well have an alternative reality, doesn`t need to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1 universe/reality/world is present in the anime.</description>

For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>noitaminA</name>
<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<name>mind fuck</name>
<description>A `mind fuck` is a slang term which describes a work that uses literary devices such as nonlinear storytelling and plot twists in order to present convoluted, yet not conflicting, themes.
A creation is usually considered a mind fuck when a casual observer is not able to discern the true meaning of a work without making a serious attempt to unravel the themes presented or when the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.
Special examples of mind fucks involve a single plot twist which completely changes the viewer`s understanding of the events in a film or novel as well as the ideas it presents.</description>

<name>Engrish</name>
<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

Normally, there is a specific idea in mind: for example, the http://anidb.net/t4859 [Young Animator Training Project] aims to stimulate the on-the-job training of next-generation professionals of the anime industry, whereas the http://anidb.net/t3763 [World Masterpiece Theatre] aims to animate classical stories from all over the world.</description>
