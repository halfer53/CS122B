<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="75416">Great Movie, worth a watch, but It definitley does not have the intensity of the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="395002">It goes without saying, DON`T watch this until you watch the original anime. It was a good movie and it can be considered a sequel, however if you JUST got done with the anime, don`t come straight into the movie as it might not have a great enough impact. Give it some time, watch something else and it might hold some impact. Ultimately, you don`t need to watch this to understand the story of the anime as a whole. This is here mostly for the fans who want a little something more. A great movie nonetheless, however you can skip it and not really miss out on the entire story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="445831">Unlike some other anime movies, which try to be more `spectacular` than the series and to have more visual effects and music, Fuka Ryouiki no Deja vu remains true to the style and atmosphere of the main series. That`s what makes it great and a must see for every fans of the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="322994">great continuation and ending of series......no complaints here, great humor, great character development and great ending.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a visual novel by http://anidb.net/cr1334 [5pb] and http://anidb.net/cr1354 [Nitroplus].
The film takes place one year after the events of the anime series. After going through a painstaking journey across multiple World Lines due to the invention of D-Mail, text messages that can be sent to the past, http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou] has apparently landed in the Steins Gate World Line, in which none of his friends would have to die and a future ruled by SERN due to the invention of a time machine no longer exists. However, Rintarou soon starts feeling the side effects of his constant time travelling across multiple World Lines, which soon builds up and causes Rintarou to suddenly vanish from existence, with only http://anidb.net/ch23271 [Makise Kurisu], the girl who he had saved thanks to his efforts, remembering him through déjà vu. It is now up to Kurisu to find a way to get Rintarou back.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>paranoia</name>
<description>Paranoia is a thought process believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of irrationality and delusion. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs, or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself. Paranoia is distinct from phobias, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame. Making false accusations and the general distrust of others also frequently accompany paranoia. For example, an incident most people would view as an accident or coincidence, a paranoid person might believe was intentional.

<description>This character sometimes wears clothes traditionally worn by and associated with the opposite sex.
Cross-dressers often hide their cross-dressing identity for a long period of time and thus tend to become adept in accurately portraying the opposite sex in terms of voice, movement, behaviour, temperament, etc.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Tokyo, as real-world location is the backdrop of this anime.
Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō, "Eastern Capital") is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the centre of the Greater Tokyo Area, and the largest metropolitan area of the world. It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace, and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family. Tokyo is in the Kantou region on the south-eastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi).

<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<name>dark atmosphere</name>
<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.
You probably will not feel uplifted or happy after watching this anime.</description>

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>

<name>creepy laugh</name>
<description>At least one character in the show inexplicably and repetitively seems to have the urgent need to laugh in a creepy, loud and usually very annoying way.
For male bad guys this seems to be a must, but some of the uppity (rich) female characters use the laugh as part of their condescending attitude as well.</description>

<name>attractive gender bender</name>
<description>For mysterious reasons, characters that are cross-dressing or capable of switching gender tend to be very attractive in their gender-swapped form.
Their surprising beauty usually leads to comedic events as well as fits of jealousy... and sometimes, unexpected crushes.</description>

<name>melodrama</name>
<description>A melodrama is a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and characters in order to appeal to the emotions, often with strongly stereotyped characters. Language, behaviour, or events which resemble melodramas are also called melodramatic. In scholarly and historical musical contexts melodramas are dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action.
Melodrama is a style of drama that has been applied on the stage, in movies and television, and radio formats, from the 18th century to the present. Because of the long timeframe in which the style has existed, it is difficult to derive a precise definition. The term melodrama is most often used pejoratively, to suggest that the work to which the term is applied lacks sophistication or subtlety.
The term originated from the early 19th-century French word mélodrame, which is derived from Greek melos, music, and French drame, drama (from Late Latin drāma, which in turn derives from Greek drān, to do, perform).

<name>cosplay restaurant</name>
<description>Cosplay restaurants are theme restaurants and pubs that originated in Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan around the year 1999. They include maid cafés and butler cafés, where the service staff dress as elegant maids, or as butlers. Such restaurants and cafés have quickly become a staple of Japanese otaku culture. Compared with service at normal cafés, the service at cosplay cafés involves the creation of a rather different atmosphere. The staff treat the customers as masters and mistresses in a private home rather than merely as café customers.
The popularity of the cosplay restaurants and maid cafés has spread to other regions in Japan, such as Osaka`s Den Den Town as well as other countries, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Mexico, and Canada.
Often such cafés or a more simple kissaten, small Japanese-style coffee shops, are part of school festivals where the protagonists` class runs one.</description>

<description>Otaku (おたく/オタク) is a Japanese term used to refer to people with obsessive interests, particularly anime, manga, and video games. A female otaku is occasionally referred to as a fujoshi. (Source: Wikipedia)
Here certain aspects of this "fandom" are presented in more detail, e.g. the creation of doujinshi (self-published amateur manga).</description>

<name>the power of love</name>
<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

<description>The protagonist - first year student attending Tokyo Denki University. He calls himself a Crazy Mad Scientist, he acts like a villain but is rather immature. After enrolling in university, he went to Akihabara to open up a laboratory called the "Future Gadget Research Establishment", where he invents gadgets that are rather useless. He also talks to himself on the cellphone, his words not making much sense. Supposedly, he has very few friends that can understand what he`s talking about.
Often calls himself "Hououin Kyouma" (鳳凰院凶真).
Mayuri and Daru just call him "Okarin" (オカリン), abbreviated after his name.
The phrase he uses to end conversations, particularly with himself, is "El Psy Kongroo"
(エル・プサイ・コングルゥ).</description>

She`s quite the optimist. She has trouble understanding complicated theories, but doesn`t mind as long as it`s enjoyable. Doesn`t like people arguing, and is depressed when things are unpleasant. Though she`d like to ease the situation in such cases, she`s not really good at reading between the lines.</description>

<description>First year student in Tokyo Denki University. Pro-active otaku, who`s got a thing for both 2-D and 3-D girls. Talks quite a lot, and uses @ch (a spinoff of 2ch) terminology. Plenty of statements he makes could be taken as sexual harassment. He and Rintarou have known each other since high school. Usually turns down Rintarou`s ridiculous requests as "annoying", but in truth gets them done in proper order. However, he trusts Rintarou as a friend. Has great confidence in his programming and hacking abilities (he doesn`t mind being called a Super Hacker, but doesn`t like it when people call him Super Haker). He`s always in front of the computer.
Has the nickname "Daru" (ダル), abbreviated after his name.</description>

<description>Second year in Kasensou Private Prepatory Academy. Mayuri`s classmate. Has the personality of a polite, well-groomed and justified kind of beautiful girl (though a guy). Uses honorifics specifically with Rintarou. Doesn`t push his opinions much upon others, but when he does he`s quite bashful and blushes quite a bit. Because he`s quite serious by nature, he simply believes what others say. Thanks to that, he thinks all the ridiculous stuff Rintarou talks about is that of reality. Rintarou makes him out to be his student on his own, and is currently in the middle of brainwashing him. A very shy person, he often turns down Mayuri`s requests to cosplay.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A research member in Victor Qondria University`s Brain Research Program (age group matches that of third-year high school, but skipped a grade through America`s educational system). She is famous in America for writing thesis papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She doesn`t like to show weakness to others and so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious and when she builds interest she pokes into things. Occassionally has views that differ from regular opinion, like, "The experiment data is more important than the subject`s privacy." Rintarou often tells her, "Hey, you`ve got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist", but she`s not one to agree to such things personally.
Rintarou has given her plenty of nicknames, in particular "Christina" (クリスティーナ) and "Assistant" (助手).</description>

<description>A girl that really likes riding bicycles, and is quite energetic, though a little crude. If you stick around her, she`s surprisingly cautious. Very helpful. A little too familiar with things, but doesn`t dig too deep. Not quite comfortable with having other people help her. For that reason, she spends as little time as possible. Her personality drastically changes when it comes to her own interests. Proactive. Has a habit of using strange and difficult vocabulary at times, but somehow you can tell she`s purposely doing so. Ended up hanging out with the Future Gadget Laboratory since she started working at the CRT TV Workshop.</description>
