<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="365884">It`s so original, good job, DEEN Studio! Highly recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="331199">Nice design and amazing story about a Japanese Art form. 
Story is well developed and easily pulls your heartstrings as events happen one after another.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="563093">Only three episodes have been released so far and I already expect this to be one of my all-time favourites, everyone should definitely start watching! I`ll update this recommendation when it`s finished.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481642">From the length of it, you wouldn`t think that thirteen episodes could be used for actually telling a good story in a decent way looking at how common it is to brazenly stuff the show with unneeded action scenes, stereotyped shallow characters, but here you go: colourful, enjoyable entertainment around an aspect of Japanese culture you probably would never care about otherwise. The production quality is also great; the animation as well as the voice acting are top notch. 

This is a very, very good series. Highly recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="494291">Once again, anime does its magic and shows us about little known (to Europeans, at least) Japanese cultural thing, this time [i]rakugo[/i], and makes it look like the centrepiece of human existence. In a good way. This was satisfying - story-wise, character-wise, pace-wise, art-wise, and enjoyable, like a good rakugo story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="261990">Just watch it. There is nothing much to add.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="37313">Exactly what I would had expected for a high class Josei of NoitaminA greatest years. A solid and pognant story with stongly fleshed out character that could restore faith in the anime medium, thanks to the quality of its execution. A must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="531127">One of the best original and amazing Anime I`ve seen before. You will see some beautiful aspects of Japanese culture even every character is very well designed and directed. You must see this gorgeous series! 10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="384413">[b]It`s the best anime from [i][u]DEEN[/u][/i] in years.[/b]

Very engaging story and characters, and a great soundtrack and directing, not to mention the superb voice acting in several scenes. Regardless of how the second season plays out, season one (which even feels relatively conclusive) of Rakugo is definitely not something that should be missed if you`re interested in a more adult, yet entertaining, anime. Do yourself a favor and check it out.</recommendation>

<description>When a certain man is released from prison, he knows exactly where he`s heading first. After falling in love with a traditional comic storyteller`s rendition of the story called "Shinigami", he is determined to become his apprentice. The performer, http://anidb.net/ch71872 [Yakumo], has never taken an apprentice before, but to everyone`s surprise, he accepts the eager ex-prisoner, nicknaming him http://anidb.net/ch71871 [Yotarou].
As Yotarou happily begins his new life, he meets others in Yakumo`s life, including Yakumo`s ward http://anidb.net/ch71873 [Konatsu]. Konatsu was the daughter of a famous storyteller, and Yakumo took her in after her father`s tragic death. Konatsu loved her father`s storytelling, and would love to become a performer in her own right, but that path is not available for women.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>josei</name>
<description>In the context of manga and associated media, the word josei refers to a female audience roughly between the ages of 15 and 44. In Japanese, the word means simply "woman", and has no anime/manga-related connotations at all. It does not comprise a style or a genre per se, but rather indicates the publisher`s intended target demographic.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.</description>

Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<name>the arts</name>
<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<description>For some reason the protagonists mother is no longer among the living. The much too early death was due to sickness or accident.
This plot device adds a certain degree of tragedy to the anime and usually has repercussions on the rest of the family: Possibly the grieve-stricken father and children barely function as humans. Or adding extra burden on the oldest daughter having to bring up the other children. Or adding emphasis on the only female child in the family, i.e. with bishounen brother and dad in a shoujo setting.
In rare cases the mother may still be alive, just not living with the rest of the family presently, i.e. on some quest and gone for a long time.</description>

<description>Animeism is a late-night Japanese programming block established in April 2012. It is devoted to anime and broadcast each Thursday night on MBS, in a fashion similar to Fuji TV`s http://anidb.net/t3865 [noitaminA] that also airs on Thursdays. Just like noitaminA, the block airs two series back to back. From April 2015 onwards, the block was moved to Friday nights.
