<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="314120">So much daaaaaaw.  If that`s your kind of thing, you`ll love this show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="430436">A very heartwarming anime. Learns you that life is more beautiful than what you think.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="474925">I`m not used to this type of animation/artwork after watching shows like HotD and Angel Beats, but despite the art style, this show is a must see for parents. Teens and non-parents won`t appreciate it, but i loved this show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="527619">Well done story, relatable characters and realistic, well presented dialog. Thankfully while it follows the manga fairly closely it doesn`t include the incest romance storyline at all, though the ending will probably leave you wanting a bit more. Definitely worth watching.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="458655">A very heat-warming anime to watch. This is quite laid back. It`s like a reading a novel! A good watch</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="479343">After 2 episodes, I started to like this show.
Sure, the animation style is not for average anime lover, but I found its unique style is perfect for the story.
Add the fact that Production I.G involved in this project, this show is a recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="376567">As a someone who works on the educational field, I must recommend this series to everyone because of it`s positive outlook on everyday life.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="335704">This anime/manga is not for the average action/ecchi loving anime viewer.

This anime will most likely as a male viewer want to make you have a daughter to care for.

If this anime triggers that feeling for you in the first 2 eps, you wont regret watching it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="734921">真的是很棒的一部动画，温馨平凡但又令人感动。
狗咖喱负责分镜的OP/ED更为动画增添了一抹淡彩。</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="352802">Very positive and clever anime. It surprises with characters, easy-to-follow plot and funny texts. After watching you only regret it finished. 
Really good one.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="106473">I would not holler for other people to watch what they think they don`t like but I guess I can`t just say not to try this because the series have so many small things that people tend to not notice or nearly forgot which  this series actually animates a part of true life very well. As many others already mentioned, this is not a series where there is a lot of "wow" factor but this series proves to be the one of the most meaningful and inspiring series I have ever watched beyond the subtle tones of the pastel-like colors of the show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="401111">What a beautiful little show.  I missed so many years of my 2 girls growing up, and watching this was both heart-warming, and very sad.  I wish I could get that time back!  I recommend this for anyone who has or likes kids. Sure wish Kouki`s mom and Rin`s guardian would get together!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="614621">I watched this anime in one sunday... Nice and relaxing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="140505">If you`re into Slice of Life that isn`t just moe pandering, you will love Usagi Drop. It`s a heartwarming and lovely story, supported by great animation and a hugable design.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="572635">Usagi Drop has portrait the family value and sudden responsible in really heart warming way. It teaches you about the responsibility and the trouble that you face and the happiness you gain with it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="199844">*First, check to see if we share similar anime tastes.* I was VERY surprised with how good this was. Normally, slice-of-life anime bore me to tears, but this anime moved me to tears (the good ones). If you`re a parent or just like kids, then you might like this anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="597419">10/10 : Being in my 20`s seeing something like this makes you want a kid in a special parenting sense. This is a very warm series for anyone with or without kids, Rin is adorable throughout the entire series, and Dai is a man among men for what he did during it all. I recommend this to anyone wanting a bit of warmth in their anime , beware though you may have an urge for a little girl in the future. XD</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="484425">Usagi Drop may be the best series in terms of emotional realism in the daily life anime genre.  With that said, there are other genres that have better or more realistic emotional realism.  It depends what genre you’re looking for.

I scored UD an 8 because the story is incomplete, meaning that there are plot lines that are started and not finished.  The finale seems open-ended not to suggest a continuation of the same but that there is more story to come.  Still, I am grateful that the anime did not follow the ending of the manga, since the mangaka took the series in a ridiculous and unbelievable direction.  Search that out at your own peril.

UD is lovely, heart-warming, and well produced at all levels.  However, I don’t think it merits as high a ranking as it has received.  If you’re interested in the best anime you’d be better off seeking out the lower rated but superior Cowboy Bebop, Shin Sekai Yori, or Revolutionary Girl Utena.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="41578">Slice of life of a single guy looking after a child.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="217707">Anime masterpieces never fail to amaze. Actually I have not visited AniDB for close to a year I think. When I return and tada, we can add this `recommendation` comment. Great. Each episode has underlying meaning to it. This is call Pure Love. And it is beyond age and background. I know how the sentiment of the author goes, as this sentiment is how I would feel as well. In our society, it is very sad that selfless pure love would hardly exist anymore. As always like all great anime masterpieces, the hidden but very strong notion of sentiment is expressed (whole lot different from Western animations). So the moral of this piece is, simply amazing.

Anyway, a note to all newbies, never state spoilers such as endings in your comments! I still see it happening, please do AniDB a favor even as no administrator would be checking at this time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="353703">Excellent series, something fresh and heartwarming at the same time, Not to mention the wonderful visual style and the great character design, I`m hooked!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="178645">nice storryyy</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="553117">If you`re looking for a heart-warming slice of life anime; this is it. Made me want to adopt a kid ;)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="511528">Loved for some reason , maybe graphics/type of story</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="488989">It is said that genius ideas are simple yet have a huge impact, that is exactly what this anime is.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="543042">There`s something magical about this series. It makes you think about the little things that make life great.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="338795">Oh yeah - it`s that good! But you don`t have to believe me, just go and see for yourself.
It`s a shame that if a second season comes and goes by the manga won`t reach the level of this masterpiece as there will be many who will dislike the conclusion.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="439927">Very cute and heart warming anime, too bad I could not rate it more than 10! :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="574030">I really loved this series.
Wish there could be a second season tho.
This show and Aishiteruze baby are 2 series that REALLY makes me wanna move to japan and have a family of my own, it is that heartwarming and i would love to see more of this series</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="620310">It`s a truly delightful series! I love animes like this!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="312729">Although I spent the whole series waiting for daikichi`s love live to progress with a certain yummy mummy, the relationship development between the main two characters is amazing. Truly one of the best series I`ve seen recently, however being a father myself I can`t help but wonder if some of the gags that made the series so watchable would go completely over a non-parents head? I mean, we`ve all been there, running gasping for breath to pickup your son/daughter. It was a really heartwarming show, but I just just wish there was more mama in it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="335602">This is the only anime I`ve watched so far that truly has literally no faults. I can`t recall a single moment I would have liked to see happen differently. You get drawn into this anime from the very first minute of the first episode. You start living with the characters, who have been designed perfectly. You can relate to all of their actions, they`re all extremely lovable and you may even recall some of your own memories. It`s just that it`s so short. I ran through the entire anime and when it ended I felt like I just watched one or two episodes. This is definitely a must see, recommended to fans of any genre and especially to people who are just starting to get into anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="558965">this series is really a must see...
so beautiful...so much beautifulness that I can`t express with words...it`s just so awesome...
you won`t regret after watching it and most likely give a similiar recommendation like most of us did... :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="567284">Recommended to people who want to get married  or to have a child! 
It is a nice and useful anime for teaching some serious lessons. And to spend time for fun!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="411316">Incredibly heartwarming, enough to touch a 20-year-old metal head like myself. One of the best animes this season, for sure. I`m usually not all that much for these types of stories, but this one is an exception. Very interesting artwork and lovely music. I really want to recommend watching this even if you usually prefer stories like Hellsing, Code Geass, etc. such as myself.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="560966">Heartwarming slice of life.  Just who`s being raised here by whom, the toddler or the adult?  The two quickly learn to live with each other, and the series chronicles both their ups and downs.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="20936">Simply amazing, ending at a perfect spot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="415527">Truly amazing story with loveable characters, awesome story filled with just niceness (what is that?!) no heavy charges of wrong emotions to the heart, they should make them all EXACTLY like Usagi Drop. Just Beautiful... Needed another 1000 episodes though...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="460147">Starts off bored me to death, yet, as it slowly reveals social problems within our society(especially the Asian ones), I was touched, really touched. A must see show for most of us indeed.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="484317">This anime is just SO unbelievably cute. Amazing charaters... and the animation is BEAUTIFUL. The art style looks somewhat abstract and yet it covers the smallest minute details of environment and everyday life (from train doors closing at a certain way to bending at a certain angle to sit down) in their scenes.... For Slice of Life fans everywhere: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="161249">It`s a warm and touching story that will leave you asking for more.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="471741">Nice visual style to counteract the normal horrific fads. Lovely down to earth slice-of-life plot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="392207">It`s a must see for whoever you are... the concept and story is simple, but the development and presentation what makes it top notch... it`s a beautiful and warm anime show...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="211735">Best anime I`ve seen for years!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="179239">Just read the recommendation of Yoruzugenga and got the feeling that he gave me a kick saying "Hey old Mecha Mom, watch this!" And damn, he was right! This anime is absolutely a must see. It brings a little peace in your mind and gives you the feeling that every thing will be alright. Especially for me, who is a Mom herself ^^ This story is far away from being boring, the animation is a peace of art. See it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="478472">this feel-good bullshit is fantastic.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="341107">It`s good. For real. I usualy don`t like all that drama stuff, but it was made someway it just gets U, it does not force it into U.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="201775">Best slice of life anime yet to be beaten. 10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="333240">A refreshing anime, one that comes at a right time, when good anime is having more and more problems getting out.
It is very relaxing. Follows the daily life of the main characters (Rin and Daikichi) as soon as they are together. It is a nice watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481748">Really good anime  Must watch 
Really heartwarming</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="491073">Simply amazing, heartwarming.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="200492">One of the best show I`ve seen, very simple in his daylife situations but so charming for its characters and their development. The story always avoids to become too sugary (hard to see nowadays)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="31111">An amazing story about a man that takes on the care of his grandfather`s "daughter" and how they both learn from the experiences. Good music, story, and art. 

If your a fan of Aria, YKK or Aishiteru ze Baby you`ll love this.

Only bad part about it is that it is too short. 11 eps doesn`t do the anime justices.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="311537">best anime this season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="218519">One of the best shows I`ve seen in a long time.
Perfect.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="479967">faultless</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="222294">OMFG how can an anime can be this cute and funny never seen something like that. so peaceful</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="267109">I usually watch sports and action anime but I fell for this anime just after the first minute! Loved the way it`s drawn and colored and the story shows promise. A heart warming anime that makes you feel good and leaves a smile on your face :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="505082">I watched the entire show in one rainy afternoon. It touched me deeply.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="283829">Hands down the best Anime of 2011 summer season.
People who liked Clannad After Story, or basically anyone who isn`t completely dead inside will like this heartwarming quickwatch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="191389">I have watched anime since I was about 10 (that`s 14 years) and this is BY FAR the B-E-S-T anime I have ever watched. Like others have said; this isn`t an action anime or anything like that, but you will get addicted after the first episode. This is a very heartwarming and down to earth anime. It deals with true life issues and situations which makes you connect on a physical and emotional level to all the characters. Unfortunately the main draw back is the lack of episodes :( at the last episode I hated knowing it was the end. They sem to have a lot more space to grow the series, but then again I have yet to read the manga, so it might continue in the manga OR (like most manga to anime now-a-days) they saw the potential for an anime and made an anime without much story line. This means they may not have enough story to expand. Lets hope there is another season :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="332307">Everyone is focused on ending but it doesn`t matter for real fans. The warmth, the intimacy and pureness is the vogue matter of this anime. You must see if you have a heart and a soul.</recommendation>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.</description>

<name>Asia</name>
<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<name>parental abandonment</name>
<description>In Japan it is a common custom for parents to leave their children alone at home and embark on a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the means of MAGICAL MONEY.
In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.</description>

<description>noitaminA (ノイタミナ) – Animation written backwards – is a Fuji Television programming block, devoted to anime, broadcast each Thursday night from 00:45 to 1:15. It was launched with the intention of expanding the target audience beyond the typical young male demographic.
The timeslot was expanded from half an hour to a full hour in 2010, and now airs Thursday nights from 00:45 to 1:45.
noitaminA aired its first non-anime series in 2010, with the premiere of the live-action adaptation of Moyashimon. On April 15, 2010, Fuji TV and FUNimation announced an agreement that allows FUNimation to simulcast series from the noitaminA block in North America within an hour of their airing in Japan.</description>

<description>Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another medium, such as film. It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.</description>

<description>Preschool education (or infant education) is the provision of learning to children before the commencement of statutory and obligatory education, usually between the ages of zero and three or five, depending on the jurisdiction.
In Japan, development of social skills and a sense of group belonging are major goals for preschools. Class sizes tend to be large, up to 40 students per class, to decrease the role of the teacher`s personality and increase the likelihood of peer interactions. Because exclusion from the group is extremely undesirable, a wide range of behaviors is tolerated.

<name>manly tears</name>
<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>Abbreviation for "three-dimensional computer generated animation" or "computer graphics" (CGI).

The difference lies in what lacks the traditional 2D animation all together and may give term to something produced entirely with 3D graphics (such as the 2006 remake of "Appleseed" , 2007`s "Vexille", the 2008 addition to the "Biohazard" series and the more well known "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" and "Advent Children").</description>
