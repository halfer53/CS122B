<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="457158">This is a legendary tale!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="468468">Very good, still somehow in the middle i got board.
NOT because it was bad, or not exciting enough, or anything like that.
It just became so predictable. Really. I was not suprised by anything that followed after episode 14 or so.
Anyway it`s still definatly worth watching and I feel like you still would miss out on something if you never did. So that`s why i recommand it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="551809">Very strong thriller until about episode 25, when it quite simply falls off a cliff. The last ten episodes or so are a real disappointment.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="139195">Intelligent/Breath taking.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="292852">Best anime ever. its the perfect anime for you if you are an anime fan or not</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="596844">Two thirds of the anime was quite enjoyable to watch. The last third was so-so.
My recommendation: Watch until episode 25 or 26.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="101924">Even though the ending is not fitting for the quality of  the beginning, this is an anime I easily recommend  with smart characters and plot ( those who like action go see another thing, this is for the ones who likes smart character). ps. I recommend to watch until episode 26, then stop watching.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="302824">Excellent. Reminds me somewhat of Sherlock Holmes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="143965">Death Note is an astonishing anime. Very unique in it`s theme and a MUST see for the ones wanting a more "mature" kind of anime. Must see! A splendid MUST SEE!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="391848">Thrills, suspense, mystery with a touch of the supernatural taken to great heights. I like detective stuff and adding a little supernatural flavor to it along with amazing twists and a very intelligent and cunning main character as a villain just made it absolutely incredible and entertaining.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="190587">THAT`S IT / AWESOME STORY / AWESOME CHARACTERS / AWESOME GRAPHICS / AWESOME MUSIC</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="132589">It`s already been said. This anime is on masterpiece status.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="550869">The Definition of Masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="484892">Death Note isn`t the most popular anime for no reason.  This anime deals with the main protagonist and his overall slide into mania because of his power to use the death note and "change the world for the better."  Overall, this anime is one of the best Thriller animes I have seen.  Also, don`t be discouraged by the fact that this was from Weekly Shounen Jump.  It may`ve been from a shounen manga, but the content of this anime is very Seinen.  So if you are looking for an excellent Seinen Thriller anime, then by all means watch Death Note.  I guarantee you you won`t regret it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="492032">YOU MUST WATCH IT !!! I think that is enough. This is my top favorite anime. You`ll just addict to it. I like the anime no matter wich episode and I think it`s the best. So definitely I recommend it as "must see".</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="422068">Why are you still reading recommendations? Just watch it. This anime is a masterpiece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="510632">Definitely a great anime. Great tension, interesting characters and an engaging plot. 

Probably not for all, but it is so good that everyone should at least check it out. Though you should probably skip the last third because it becomes quite bad.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="558725">The only anime series that kept me as interested in the beginning as it did towards the end. Great plot and characters, graphics and music. Everything about it is perfect except the end, which in my opinion is a bit weak. Other than that it`s great. Too bad there aren`t many anime series like this one, but i guess that`s what makes it unique.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="271621">Its a mind blowing anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="400353">A must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="415427">The best anime ever created. A masterpiece beyond words.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481279">A witty thriller with a classical theme of hubris: a rarity by today`s standards.
This series keeps you guessing till the very end because you never know how things are going to go till they happen. Also the concept behind the "Death Notebook" is very intriguing and deep, making you think of how you would use it if you had one. Animation quality, music, and character development are also above par for sure.
A must see if you enjoy intelligent and/or dark animes.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="562257">One can simply not explain the epicness of this anime through mere words.</recommendation>

<description>Bored with his deteriorating world and the laconic way of his fellows, shinigami Ryuuk drops his Death Note on Earth and watches to see if it stirs up anything interesting. His plan succeeds beyond his wildest expectations when the Death Note is found by brilliant high school senior Light Yagami, who is also bored with a world he considers rotten. Although initially he regards the book as a prank, Light soon discovers, through experimentation, that the book`s claim is true: picture a person in your mind as you write the person`s name in the Death Note, and that person dies 40 seconds later of of a heart attack (although a different time frame and manner of death can be specified). Armed with that power, Light sets out on a quest he sees as noble: make the world a better place by eliminating all its criminals using the Death Note. Soon cast as the mysterious "Kira" (a Japanese pronunciation of the English "killer") in the media and on the Internet, some take exception to his playing god, most notably the police and the enigmatic master detective L, who resolves to do everything in his power to stop Kira. Light counters by doing everything in his power to prevent people from identifying or interfering with him, even if that means getting rid of people investigating him.</description>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<tag id="2608" weight="0" localspoiler="false" globalspoiler="false" verified="true" update="2012-12-04">
<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>university</name>
<description>Since college/university students are typically at least eighteen years old, with stories covering mature everyday life topics, you will find the college setting quite often in seinen and josei anime.
Topics that can now be covered - as compared to High School settings - are higher education (i.e. coping with higher intellectual stress), the more adult party life (i.e. alcohol, smoking, sex), the issues of daily life vs. studying - especially when having to work to pay for bills, and finally the possible friction between those in and out of college. </description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control. (Source: Wikipedia)</description>

<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".

<description>The primary antagonist of the series, L is the world`s top-rated detective and tasked with tracking down and arresting Kira. As such, he is Light`s arch-enemy. He often takes drastic strategies to confuse and force the hand of his opponents, and his dishevelled appearance disguises his brilliance. He enjoys sugar, and in nearly every scene including him, he is found eating cake or confectionery and drinking highly sweetened tea.</description>

When he finds the Death Note, dropped in the human world by the shinigami Ryuk, he decides to use it to kill all criminals and earns the title Kira.

<description>Mello, a character present in the anime and manga versions, was an orphan who grew up with Near and Matt in Wammy`s House, Watari`s shelter for "gifted" children. Like Near and Matt, Mello was one of the candidates to become L`s successor. Similar to L`s fondness for sweets, he is often seen eating bars of chocolate. Although Mello is quite intelligent, he often lets his emotions get the better of him.</description>

<name>Near</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>A calm and stoic character that appears in the second half of the series. In the anime and manga versions, Near is a primary candidate to become L`s successor and calls himself N during the course of his investigations. He shares a number of similarities with L. Much like how L plays with things such as sugar cubes and forks, Near is frequently shown playing with toys or hair, and he is constantly shown sitting in an unusual manner. After L`s death, he was asked to join forces with Mello, who refused (it is explained that Near lacks the emotional insight to beat L, while Mello is too emotional and impulsive). Near then gained the support of the Government of the United States and formed the Secret Provision for Kira (SPK). In the `extra` manga story, set after the end of the series, Near states that, while he respects Light`s drive for justice, he can never find his `Kira` actions excusable. His real name is Nate River.
In the film L: Change the World, L grants the name "Near" to a Thai boy who is a mathematical genius; L intends for Near to succeed him.</description>

<description>Criminal prosecutor, fanatical supporter of Kira, and the fourth Kira. Mikami is selected as the new Kira by Light, purely based on his intuition, when he needs a new Kira proxy to hide his identity. He has a sense of righteousness that stems from his childhood, though his perspective was warped over the years. Mikami wishes to punish those he considers to be evil, (which, to Light`s dismay, includes unproductive people and reformed criminals), and worships Kira as a God.</description>

<description>Kiyomi Takada first appears for a short period as Light`s classmate and girlfriend; Light appeared with Takada in public to disguise the fact that he also conversed with Misa. Takada is a popular girl also known as "Miss To-Oh", short for To-Oh University, or "`Refined` Takada". She returns later in the story as an announcer of NHN chosen by Mikami to be Kira`s spokesperson to the world. Light eventually romances her in order to covertly deliver messages to Mikami, and have her use pages of the Death Note to judge criminals as part of Light`s plan. Takada dislikes Misa and suggests to Light that he should kill Misa on several occasions.</description>

<name>Ryuk</name>
<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Ryuk is the main Shinigami of the Death Note series. Bored with the activities (or lack thereof) of the Shinigami realm, Ryuk obtains a second Death Note and drops it in the human realm for someone to find, hoping to amuse himself. He deliberately writes the instructions on the front page (in English, which he assumed to be the most popular language in the human realm) so people would understand its purpose. The Death Note is discovered by Yagami Light, and Ryuk follows him around for much of the series to see how Light uses it. Ryuuk has a fairly humanoid appearance. His skin is grey, or a purple-ish colour and his limbs are abnormally long and he has bulging yellow eyes with red irises.</description>

<description>Rem is the Shinigami who gives Misa her Death Note. Like Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, Rem did not get hers through trickery. The Shinigami Gelus, who had fallen in love with Misa, sacrificed himself to kill her destined murderer. In doing so he was reduced to dust, leaving only his Death Note. Touched by this act, Rem delivered Gelus` Death Note to Misa, since it was her life he saved. Her appearance is quite skeletal, with long, spinal cord-like arms and bone-like skin.</description>

<description>Gelus appears in a flashback when Rem explains how to kill a Shinigami. He is a small, doll-like Shinigami whose appearance suggests that he was poorly sewn together from mismatched fabric. He only has one eye, despite having two eye sockets.
In the flashback, Rem recalls Gelus watching over a younger Amane Misa in the human world. Knowing that it was Misa`s final day, she watches with him. Having fallen in love with Misa, Gelus uses his Death Note to kill Misa`s destined murderer, against Rem`s protests. Gelus is reduced to a pile of dust as punishment for extending a human life, leaving behind only his Death Note. Rem delivers his Death Note to Misa because it was her that he saved. In the film, he simply drops it and it lands near Misa.</description>

<description>Sidoh is the Shinigami whose Death Note was stolen by Ryuk. By the time he realises this, however, the note has already changed hands several times, ending up in the hands of Mello`s gang (more specifically, Mello`s subordinate, Jack Neylon). After repeatedly hounding Ryuk for its return, he tracks down the gang to get it back. In order to regain his Note, Sidoh agrees to help Mello`s gang against Near`s SPK and the Kira investigation team. He wears heavy clothing, obscuring most of his features, and his head is wrapped in bandages.</description>

Despite gambling with Deridovely much of the time, he is a poor gambler. Obata said that, as Guuku appears in the first chapter, he wanted for Guuku to look like a monster to keep it simple. Obata decided to use a cattle skull in the design as he felt that using a regular skull would be boring.</description>
