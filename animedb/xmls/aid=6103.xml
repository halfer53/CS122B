<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="583710">I really enjoyed this anime, funny and cute but it really needs a second season to finish it off. Kind of just ended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="558725">A very entertaining anime with a lot of funny moments. However, as the story progresses, it tends to get a bit frustrating and the actual ending isn`t that great either but that might be because the manga is still unfinished and by the looks of it it still has a lot more to go, so i don`t think that a second season will be released anytime soon.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="608137">It is like nana, but better in my opinion. The main female have a strong personality, and the characters are well draw. The overall story is good, but it is not complete cuz it never got a second season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="338013">full of laughter and fun :) nice story line</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="139195">It will slowly grow on you. Also it`s not as lighthearted as it seems in the beginning.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="236884">a great anime - totally recomend it!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="29218">Wonderful Slapstick with good Growth. Looking forward to an, eventual, second season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="187816">Just one of the best series i`ve ever seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="343276">very funny</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="97041">It started out slow, but soon enough, I found myself aching for the next episode. A fun comedy to watch that`s both cute and shows it`s emotional sides well.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="539481">Comedy, Romance, and acting! An entertaining anime.

BEWARE: This series has some kind of "unfinished love story". They don`t kiss - not even after 25 episodes, considering this is partly a romance. 

I just finished the season and it reminds me of "NANA". But with acting instead of music, which unfortunately is harder to portray in anime - but still done properly with humerous, classic anime effects.

There would be more than enough to have a second season. For that next season I wish it to continue as usual, except they speed up the love pase and seriousness of the main characters like in Nana.
Until the story is finished they will never be able to get more than 7.9 from me.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="303392">Very good and funny piece of story. One complaint - if you want to watch this, be prepared to read manga after season. Anime isn`t finished and there`s no plans for continuation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="180244">Great story, and one of the best manga-&amp;gt;anime translations I`ve seen so far.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="417094">This anime is really something out of the ordinary.

A must see for anyone whether or not you generally like this type of anime.

Strong characters, brilliant humor and awesome animations are just a few of the many things that will keep you glued to the screen when you watch this series. MUST SEE.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="295646">this is a must see for shoujo lovers out there! and for those who despise shoujo until now, you should watch this. perhaps you will change your mind ;) this is one of the best shoujo with romantic comedy genre ever. detailed storyline, unique main characters with strong personalities for each person. not to mention those witty super-deformed scenes!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="354843">it is really good</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="542192">I watch it twice and never get bored, very good anime both animation and story. It has an open end but manga still continues. I also recommend manga, story really fired up in there</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="140923">One of the best love drama anime I`ve seen.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="25689">Hilarious!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="335178">One of the best shoujo out there.Hilarious.Don`t get discouraged by its weak first episodes(compared to the rest),it takes up amazingly!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="67231">Back when this fair aired, I only watched the first episode and put it aside. Yesterday I found myself watching 19 episodes straight, caught in a drama-fun mix that wouldn`t let me go.
Brilliant character development, witty humor and a lovely story.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="178645">my heart beats like crazy. tears. if you dont meet a real love yet . you must watch... like me</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="16346">Amazing!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="221885">Very entertaining, interesting main character, awesome portrayal of comedy which reminds of the likes of Nodame. The pace is top notch too, you can easily keep watching all episodes with barely a break.
If there`s a flaw with this, it`s the romance part. There are barely any advances, and the end feels a bit rushed. Some more episodes or some more focus on a satisfying romance would`ve felt better.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="344940">I started the first episode on a Friday night.  About 9 hours and one meal later, I finished it and then immediately started watching the first episode again.  I had never watched a full series start to finish in one sitting before, and I watched this not once but twice in the same sitting.  The pacing, humor, emotions, plot, and fantastic characters keep you going from start to finish and leave you itching for more!

The only regret I have from watching this is knowing that this story, even in manga, isn`t finished, and probably won`t be finished for a very long time.  :(</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="313872">Awesome comedy-romance!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="332327">One masterpiece with awesome story and characters. One of the best anime ever made, watch it and you will not regret it!!!</recommendation>

<description>Kyoko has devoted her life to Shotaro. When Shotaro came to Tokyo to debut as a singer, she followed him and worked to provide for him. But one day, Kyoko overhears Shota telling his manager that Kyoko means nothing to him. She`s just convenient, a housekeeper. This makes Kyoko furious, and she vows revenge on Shotaro. But Shotaro just laughs at her, saying she won`t be able to touch him because he`s now a popular singer and she`s a nobody. So Kyoko decides to get into showbiz and become even more popular than Shotaro to humiliate him. Unfortunately, Shotaro has destroyed Kyoko`s ability to love, and she discovers that it is a prerequisite for her to debut from her chosen company, LME. The president of LME puts her into a new section made for those who caught his eye but have something missing. It`s name... Love Me Section. On her way to become a pro actress she`s meeting new people like Kanae Kotonami, Maria Takarada, Yukihito Yashiro and the important person in this story - Ren Tsuruga.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.

Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.</description>

<description>The arts represent an outlet of human expression, usually influenced by culture, and driven by human creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and film, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind`s relationship with its environment.

<name>important haircut</name>
<description>When a character cuts off his or her hair, it often symbolizes a rite of passage or bout of character growth. A princess striking out on an adventure, or a new recruit at boot camp, for instance. Hair is something that takes time and effort to grow, so parting with it voluntarily can be a powerful act.
This is particularly a big deal when women get haircuts. Yet in fiction, even an accidental hair slicing can leave a character with a surprisingly even cut.
In many religions (Western Christianity, Ancient Egyptian religion, and others) priests and/or monks cut/shave their hair. Roman Catholic nuns also tend to cut and mantain their hair short under their veils when they enter the nunneries. The cutting of one`s own hair is also a part of Buddhist mythology, specifically something done by Siddhartha himself early on in his path to enlightenment, so anime examples might draw from this as an allusion. There are also some cultures, including Native American and many Asians, where a person would cut his or her hair as an act of grief, disgrace, or even rebellion. In the Confucian tradition, hair (like the rest of your body) is considered a gift from your parents and may not be damaged without a very good reason. Furthermore, prisoners and psychiatric patients commonly have their heads shaved, often to prevent the spread of lice, but sometimes also as a demeaning measure.

Differing from "http://anidb.net/t2652 [Super Deformed]", here only the face changes to an extreme degree, not the whole body of the protagonist.</description>

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Instead of staying home and attending High School in Kyoto, Kyouko travels with her childhood friend Shou Fuwa to Tokyo to help him while he makes it big as an idol. When she finds out he only invited her so she could be his maid, her heart and innocence are shattered. More vengeful than depressed, she swears to avenge herself. Shou comments the only way to do this would be to beat him in show business, so that`s what she decides to do. She changes her hair style and begins the task of applying to Shou`s rival company (Akatoki Agency), L.M.E.</description>

<description>He is a typical stuck-up star, and is also very ruthless. Shou had no qualms about tricking Kyouko into going with him to Tokyo so she could be a free servant for him. He also had even less qualms about being extremely cruel to her when she discovered this. Shou eventually figured out that Kyouko was in L.M.E., and was surprised to see her transformation.</description>

<description>Kotonami`s character, at first glance, looks like she was being set up to be the villain to Kyouko`s heroine, but as with all of the female characters in this series, Kanae is much more sympathetic than she appears. While there was fur flying about at the beginning, both girls have a need for a true friend, and ultimately find that in each other (albeit reluctantly on Kanae`s part and too willingly on Kyoko`s part.</description>
