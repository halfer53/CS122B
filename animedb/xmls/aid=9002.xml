<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="240459">For those who watched tons of anime and, being slightly tired of mainstream series, want something fresh, unusual and interesting, - and serious. Lots of gore. Lots of love.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="241461">They jumped ahead alot in this serie with the years that passed. it felt like as soon as the serie got exciting they jumped 3-4 years ahead and the ppl were 3-4 years older. even tho the ending explained alot I still didnt like it. but the story was good all and all, the rest not so much.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="632696">I finished this anime today, and I must say I`m not impressed. The story is painfully slow, with plot gaps everywhere. It`s hard to understand aswell due to various time-skips and other..."events". In my opinion the ending was extreamly unsatisfying aswell. Most people do not agree with me on this one, but if looked at from a neutral point of view (not cheering for the humans just because they are humans), you`ll realize who the true villian actually is. The characters are very naive in general, falling for the simplest of tricks. If you like romance however, this anime is for you. If you can handle outdrawn acts and naive decision, then this is an anime for you.

Overall 4/10.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="616779">mixed feelings about it- it could have been one the best anime of its generation but somehow it became a good weird anime instead -let me explain , while the art is amazing, ost epic(new world symphony) ,the animation flawless , the concept/story daring.. but wtf ? for some reason halfway through it becomes some kind of lovestory with gay and not gay and then they change, cant make up their mind.. it very much like the show wich is very inconsistent: slow pace then super fast pace. The direction/story telling makes the show mysterious: it works and its nice  but in the same time it   draws u out of the show - in the point of "not caring" that much anymore about those people ... especially since many times over u just want to slap them so Naive/stupid they are - idk- overall, i think it is still a great show , just feel disappointed: the subjects talked about are  grand and at times it NAILED it but i cant help to think it could have been so much more  still worth the try</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="177640">This is Akira`s world a millenia after, watch it, it`s worth the time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="1057">Wow this is a really great anime... Definitely really good. It`s very well written from the very first episode to the last with almost no filler. Action packed, brutal, emotional, it displays the growth of children from pure and innocent to adults who take on the responsibility of the world around them, even if they don`t want to.

I would definitely recommend this series as it is probably going to be the best anime out this year.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="202168">The plot thickens with every episode. What started rather simple has turned out to be one hell of a major plot. To me it`s No1 for the season.

Definitely recommended, but it`s a rather unusual series. Watch past ep. 3 or 4 and decide if it`s still worth it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="371333">This is a Japanese mash-up of By the Waters of Babylon and The Giver. The result is good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="258362">Good story. The characters are decently developed so that their actions and behaviours are consistent with their personalities. Overall this was a nice reminder of how good animes can be.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="559673">a great anime that you shouldnt miss...an anime with great storyline, set up in a dark dystopia world far in the futute, with great atmosphere and so well drawn pictures.Also it is unique on its own artistic way, with a music geniously made that it couldnt fit more perfectly!I total recommend this one ...</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="292889">So far (episode 4) this is a brilliantly crafted dystopian tale. A "what if" scenario that extrapolates how society would evolve if paranormal abilities came into existance.

The lead characters innocence plays nicely with the underlying themes of the first episodes, which at least for me, led to a lot of guessing about how sinister the world they live in really is. 

For those who like to think and theorycraft while watching a show, this is a must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="370510">Outstanding. Extremely compelling, imaginative and mature. To ask more of an anime than this provided would be unconscionable.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="494720">beauty-sad story
heavy plot and twist
deep character development
if you looking for fan-service don`t watch this,
if you looking for story then this anime definitely for you !
personally, this is the best anime i`ve ever seen</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="161106">It`s a dark story, but still very interesting and one of the more unique ones I`ve seen for a while. The music is nice, the animation is pretty impressive and the story works. It`s overall a bit messy ride, but still satisfying.

I dont think anyone should miss out on this show, one of this seasons freshest.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="373896">I really like this anime. I think the plot was amazing. After all the dramatic build up though, the ending seemed kinda pale in comparison. And I wish they went more deep with the characters and the history. I loved what it showed about humans. Bits -or more like the principles- of what happened in Shinsekai Yori happened in real life. That was probably what grabbed me the most about this anime. Also the animation and the soundtracks are very well done.
Definitely recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="546492">Shinsekai Yori is a Great Anime, one with the most well developed storyline. You`ll really hardly foresee what will happen, but nothing is left unexplained (sometimes you need to wait a bunch of episodes though). The characters are really well pictured, and you won`t find the usual stereotype with the same line each episode that seems to be so common in the recent animes..

I really like the art stile, it fits the contest of the story, but one of the thinks that made me fell in love with this anime is the music. Is so suited, it build such an atmosphere around this mysterious and cryptic world!

If you`re looking for a mature anime, this is totally for you! Actually, this is the only anime with such a polished story that it makes me want to read the novel(and i will the instant it will be translated to english)

Ps: the first 2 episodes can be a little confusing if you`re not caught by the mystery, but ep.3 will give an accurate view of the world and answer many questions</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="423020">Absolutely amazing serie. Thoughtful, like reading a well-written book. Do yourself a favor : allow your consciousness to wander in the strange, frightful and beautiful country of the human mind.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="64801">Masterpiece, but be warned, this show is truly dark, perhaps the darkest one I have ever seen. Many shows play with dark themes, blurring the border between good guys and bad ones, but this show escalates it to a new level. This may not be apparent in the first half of the anime, but it will be become utterly clear in the last episode. To fairly judge and appreciate this show you must watch it till the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="729755">"Horror" isn`t quite a word I`d use to describe this series. It`s more a psychological horror than anything. There`s no jump scares, and it won`t spook you, but you`ll be contemplating a lot of you, your society, and the universe by the time this series is over. It exposes the evils of humanity, and even the evils that come with subjective experience. In this world, good and evil only exist in parallel to "us and them", and this series does a shockingly good job at showing what happens if you discover how your villains are feeling too.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="554678">Post apocalyptic and philosophical! Right up my alley!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="198548">Haha Wow, soo good and yet depressing til the end.  Didn`t really like the route it chose tho, later half I believe.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="336778">This show is a bit hard to get in. Don`t drop it! You would miss one of the best animes aired those last years.  A really strong and deep plot that ends beautifully.  A true masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="585578">I truly love this anime, for me, this is a fantastic piece of art. The atmosphere, the story, the characters, everything is perfect.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="404499">Very intriguing. At first I thought it was slow paced but now I do see how it wonderfully build up very special and disturbing atmosphere. 
Must see!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="315890">Has blown my mind, only now on episode 18 do I feel as though I may know what`s coming next, yet it`s still rather vague.

This anime has had me on the edge of my seat from episode one and  this may be the cause of my only complaint, the episodes feel too short! You want to know what`ll happen next!

An amazing, original and well executed story. Must See.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="199844">*First, check to see if we share similar anime tastes.* Extremely intelligent plot, and at times, even deep. Don`t let the preview art trick you into thinking this is just some anime for kids. A must-see for mature audiences, but it might be too much for children.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="416016">A compelling story and great sound track. One of the best dystopia anime`s currently available, it keeps you wondering about the power(lessness) of humankind</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="605168">In the beginning of the anime, I was a bit confused.
But as the first episodes went by, I was hooked!
For me this is the best anime I have ever seen! Because the world is fantastic, the characters exciting and the last episodes are just....wow</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="48697">What would the world where humans are gods look like?
Shinsekai Yori`s answer is both beautiful and disturbing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="588687">This anime consist of a unique story. Compared to a typical anime the atmosphere is quite dark and philosophical. It`s a kind of utopia and dystopia for a society in the future and how humans could have evolved to. Be warned...this is no series with a happy ending...it`s quite serious and in the end it leaves you with a bitter aftertaste...but that`s also the reason why this anime is so good. The story remains true to itself and is thought-provoking. Stick to it...because the story is developing over time and unfold during it...This series is the reason I love watching anime...and I hope for more to come. Everyone who liked series like Casshern Sins, Kaiba or Ergoy Proxy should give it a try. Have fun ;) You won`t regret it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="730431">This is a Masterpiece. It may be a little hard to watch at some beginning episodes for some people, but never ever drop this anime. Story, music, and characterization are superb.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="527289">This dystopian future (1000 years from now) series reveals exciting, terrifying, and tragic elements VERY consistently. Your jaw just might drop at how future humanity deals with its gaining of telekinesis, AKA "Power". The story spans decades following the protagonist, Saki, and through her, we learn about the fragile state of humanity and their neighbors, the Monster Rats. Though all characters are likeable, none of them are safe from monsters, government, or each other. All characters follow compelling arcs and clear motives. All episodes build toward one satisfying conclusion; and even after the climax, the series gives your gut one last twist before letting you go. Though the budget doesn`t allow for superb animation; the use of character design, color, and background art keep things looking crisp. Then the story and acting are PLENTY strong enough to carry things forward.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="530450">Truly a must-see. While the story revolves about the main characters, it`s more about the world they live in and how they accept/reject it after learning of its dark past, and how society works in it. The story is quite different from other stories where the main character(s) single-handedly changes the world, and its ruling structure; and everyone is content.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="410747">I think this TV is very good. One of the best I`v watched</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr30705 [Kishi Yuusuke]`s award-winning 2008 speculative fiction novel Shinsekai yori.
The story is set in Japan a millennium from now. Five children — the protagonist http://anidb.net/ch41838 [Saki], http://anidb.net/ch41837 [Satoru], http://anidb.net/ch41839 [Maria], http://anidb.net/ch41836 [Mamoru], and http://anidb.net/ch41840 [Shun] — have been born and raised in a tranquil town that can be described as a utopia, overflowing with water and green foliage. The world is ruled by people who have the cursed power or the gods` power of telekinesis.
After a certain incident, Saki and the others come to realize the true nature of their world. Before long, they learn everything, including the bloody history that brought humanity to this state. The five throw themselves into life-threatening adventure and fight to protect friends and a world on the brink of collapse.

<name>extrasensory perception</name>
<description>Extrasensory perception (ESP), involves reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses but sensed with the mind. The term was coined by Sir Richard Burton, and adopted by Duke University psychologist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as telepathy and clairvoyance, and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition. ESP is also sometimes casually referred to as a sixth sense, gut instinct or hunch, which are historical English idioms. The term implies acquisition of information by means external to the basic limiting assumptions of science, such as that organisms can only receive information from the past to the present.
In Japanese usage the term is often misappropriated to refer to any supernatural, non-magical, super power. Users of such powers are called `esper` in Japanese. The term `esper` is not normally in use outside of Japan but is slowly being introduced due to its usage in anime and manga.
In anime/manga the following powers, among others, are described as ESP:
- telepathy
- precognition
- clairvoyance
- retrocognition
- remote viewing
- aura reading
- out-of-body experiences (OBE)
- psychokinesis</description>

<name>psychokinesis</name>
<description>The term psychokinesis (from the Greek ψυχή, "psyche", meaning mind, soul, heart, or breath; and κίνησις, "kinesis", meaning motion, movement; literally "mind-movement"), also referred to as telekinesis (Greek τῆλε + κίνησις, literally "distant-movement") with respect to strictly describing movement of matter, sometimes abbreviated PK and TK respectively, is a term coined by publisher Henry Holt to refer to the direct influence of mind on a physical system that cannot be entirely accounted for by the mediation of any known physical energy. Examples of psychokinesis could include distorting or moving an object, and influencing the output of a random number generator.
The following powers, among others, are psychokinetic powers:
- Telekinesis: movement of matter at the micro or macro (visible objects, life forms, etc.) levels; move, lift, agitate, vibrate, spin, bend, break, or impact)
-- Speed up or slow down the naturally occurring vibrations of atoms in matter to alter temperature, possibly to the point of ignition if combustible (also known as pyrokinesis when speeding up vibrations, and cryokinesis when slowing them down)
-- Self levitation (rising in the air unsupported, flying)
- Influencing events (sports, gambling, election, prolongation of life, etc.)
- Biological supernatural healing
- Teleportation (disappearing and reappearing elsewhere)
- Phasing through matter
- Electro-psychokinesis, the ability to control any and all electrical, electronic, or electro-mechanical devices such as computers, elevators, FAX machines, etc.
- Transmutation of matter
- Metamorphosis Shape-shifting
- Energy shield (force field)
- Control of magnetism
- Control of photons (light waves/particles)
- Thoughtform projection aka telepathic projection (a physically perceived person, animal, creature, object, ghostly entity, etc., created in the mind and projected into three-dimensional space and observable by others)
- Control of gravity
- Control of physical matter without physical interaction (water, air, ...)

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<description>In our terms, a proxy battle is a battle where humans use creatures/robots to do the fighting for them, either by commanding those creatures/robots or by simply evolving them/changing them into battle mode. Often the training aspect is also involved, or in some cases the proxies are nothing more than holographic representatives of some other variation of competition (like for example a card game). While many popular shounen anime fit under this category, it`s not limited to shounen anime.</description>

<description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy, Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<name>dystopia</name>
<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<description>Story-wise, genetic modification is usually centred on humans, probably the most subtle and creepy way of messing with mankind. Playing with the fear of the unknown, genetically altered humans are technically a new species, that may not only surpass but actually replace unaltered humans. The level of modification will vary from subtle changes in "look" (e.g. super-human beauty), to mental enhancements (PSI powers), to more or less atrocious adaptations to extreme environments (breath under water, radiation resistance). Note that changes in Aliens would be difficult to pinpoint, after all they are alien.</description>

<name>gore</name>
<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>flashback</name>
<description>A flashback is a moment in which someone remembers events from their past. In fiction, flashbacks are used primarily to give insight into a character`s mind or to reveal information which had been previously kept from the audience. They normally consist essentially of new content; in some cases, they may also consist of short snippets of already displayed content, as in http://anidb.net/ch23266 [Okabe Rintarou]`s flashbacks in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate], but even in these cases the flashbacks are used to look into what the character is thinking. As such, they are different from and should not be confused with recaps, which are old content being shown again for no particular purpose other than padding or reminding the audience of the events up to that point. As a rule of thumb, to qualify as a flashback, the scene must advance the show`s content in some way or form; anything else is just a recap.</description>
