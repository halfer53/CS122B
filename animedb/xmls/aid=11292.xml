<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="164249">It`s not the most innovative time-travel story, but it`s decent enough to keep you watching it. It also have a well-rounded ending, which isn`t always the case in animes. 

The only thing that bothered me that it was never explained what caused the time travel, but if you can see past that and you like time-travel, give it a try.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="114373">This is one of the series that keep you captivated and make you want to keep watching the next episodes. Although the plot is kinda predictable (for me atleast), but still very well made. Heart warming children friendship, Parents-children relationship, nice Graphic animation.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="725935">There is never a dull moment in this show as everything happens for a reason.  A lot of people can relate to the situations in show as it touches a wide range of people`s upbringings/backgrounds: abused, rich, poor, lonely, popular, fulfilled yet lacking, etc.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="345228">Great anime. Though very sad with happy moments story. With time loop/paradox and detective setting novel. To learn/to teach about human`s happiness and horror.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="414179">"better anime", "one of the best of 2016" and so on for Butterfly effect clone. I agree, it`s a good watch, but it lacks action, lacks critical sharpness. Episode 10 should have been last episode, but they decided to cling to slice of life series to the end.

 We were fed with bad titles a lot, that is why this average good title shines like a sun</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="405614">I LOVED this anime!
if you like mystery and plot twist type anime this is a MUST SEE!
9/10 !!!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="365884">Love the plot twist. If you`re a mistery fan, you should watch this!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="261990">Sadly the story, villain and the rest is pretty much obvious after first 3 chapters. Animation is very good (for this kind of anime), VA is really good (actually only Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has better one in this season), characters are likeable and well thought but...  Let`s just say plot isn`t the most interesting thing in this one. Unless you know only very poor criminal stories. IMO I would also reccomend watching it with few days between each episode as it fell better than watching them all at once.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="284422">Only + no -
+ Twisted plot, you never guess whats happens next
+ Good, developed characters
+ Suspense, lot of it
+ Well-balanced dose of humor 
+ No sequel ahead</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="306510">Awesome anime.
One of these rare master pieces that come once every few years.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="458516">Good thriller. This show can keep you in suspense every episode. It`s hard to find an article, that is so stable in squeezing of feelings out of you.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="441125">Beautiful!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="459461">Really great story with nice animation and music.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="79717">While the villain is kind of obvious (because they don`t have a large selection of suspcious characters), it was still a great watch. Animation, characters, everything was interesting and I really enjoyed the series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="432445">Absolutely spectacular! This well-paced thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat. The whodunit plotline is “hai tenshon” in both senses, but the action is interspersed with funny and cute moments as a reminder of the innocence of childhood. This is no lighthearted story though, dealing with serious issues such as child abuse, broken families, and the personal determination of a hero wanting to change the future. The snowy animation is solid and beautifully executed, exuding a gloomy atmosphere with just a glimmer of hope to keep you guessing what will happen next.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="229307">great anime no doubt that  you really must watch no matter what 

10/10</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="65687">Satoru does not play the same as I would in many places but his actions are still in character, though perhaps a bit more naive than a 29er. As a consequence the plot turns are not as I anticipate and I don`t feel I am being patronized by the author`s choices. A very engaging story. Lots of humanity in it, and suspense as well.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="615767">Honestly one of the better anime that I`ve watched. Great psychological mystery, with some of my favorite character interactions. The ending wasn`t amazing for me, given the immense amount of character development and buildup, but it was satisfactory.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="540164">This is so good.  Given the premise and limited actions a child could do.  You would think it`s a forgone conclusion.  What has happen, will happen and can`t be changed.  With a little knowledge at hand, even under peer pressure.  Can he change the past.  Small changes have a big effect, (butterfly effect) but can he stop.  The murderous rampage of a serial killer?</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="494291">Saying more than a few lines would be spoiling the story, so let`s just say that this contains nice portion of thrill, mystery, excitement flavoured with child friendship and darker theme. It`s captivating, which should be the #1 priority of all anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="475247">Great story, one of the best i ever seen. If you like Steins;Gate or any other anime/movie/game etc. that had story based on butterfly effect, you definitely love this one.</recommendation>

<name>detective</name>
<description>A detective is an investigator, generally either a member of a law enforcement agency or as an individual working in the capacity of private investigators, tasked with solving crimes and other mysteries, such as disappearances, by examining and evaluating clues and records in order to solve the mystery; for a crime, this would mean uncovering the criminal`s identity and/or whereabouts. In some police systems, a detective position is achieved by passing a written test after a person completes the requirements for being a police officer; in others, detectives are college graduates who join directly from civilian life without first serving as uniformed officers.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>amnesia</name>
<description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.</description>

<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

Another use of narration comes in the form of a dominant voice belonging to one of the protagonists, intended only for the viewer and revealing the intimate thoughts to whom it belongs. This type of narration occurs frequently throughout the duration of the episode or movie.</description>

<name>multi-anime projects</name>
<description>Many anime are created as part of larger projects encompassing many shows without direct relation to one another. Normally, there is a specific idea in mind: for example, the http://anidb.net/t4859 [Young Animator Training Project] aims to stimulate the on-the-job training of next-generation professionals of the anime industry, whereas the http://anidb.net/t3763 [World Masterpiece Theatre] aims to animate classical stories from all over the world.</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.
