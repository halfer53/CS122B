<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="108726">Real gr8, also really heartaching. If you liked Voices of  Distant Past, this would qualify as the genre... &lt;br /&gt;I see this theme appear more and more in anime, and I get the feeling Ill have to get to live in Japan very soon before my youth ends and I will not be able to live these feelings ever again. Am I turning emo? lol :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="5807">Well worth spending some time on.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="484425">The animation in 5 Centimeters Per Second was breathtakingly beautiful.  The level of detail that went into every frame was astounding.  The story was sweet and moving.

My one disappointment was that the last vignette didn`t work nearly as well as the first two.  I`m guessing the studio ran out of time or money, which lead to a decision to turn the third episode into a montage-music video.

I suppose one could argue that the last episode was demonstrating the "speed of life," or something like that, but the story in episode three left me wanting.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="52807">for thouse who defenetly love beyond the clouds this one is not better then beyond the clouds on my opinion but its perfect!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481845">When I watched this movie, suddenly some lines of the song `So close` came to my mind.
`A life goes by. Romantic dreams must die. So I bid my goodbye and never knew...`
OMG! What am I saying?! I want to say that this is definitely a must see. xD</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="114582">Must see. Animes like Byousoku 5 Senchimeetoru are more focused on the relationships between characters, their feelings and emotions, you must go into their lives, if not, you`re going to think something`s missing. The animation and visual art used on this help you very well with that matter.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="571562">Beautiful movie. A must see for every romance/drama fan.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="399845">A movie that entails realism to it, a movie that has a full of depth for the allotted time it`s given.

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="354280">Some of the most beautiful animation available, with a wonderfully bittersweet story.  An excellent choice.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="65644">I have yet to see such a tremendous work of art in Japanese animation. You MUST see the 1080P version, its nothing but pure art, the attention to details is exquisite, the story has to be one of the saddest but most beautiful you might come across, but its message and meaning is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST see it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="408065">Absolutely must see ! 1080 recommended</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="232143">Graphical whoring with moody, slow-paced flow. If you wish to be stunned with beautiful scenery and enjoy the moment, this is a MUST SEE. (Other works of Makoto Shinkai also highly recommended.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best in 1080p, as it really is not just an upscale. Unlike most 1080p, 5cm/s not only sharpens line-art but also adds detail to small things (snow drop, starts, horizon, clouds, every small object).</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="427215">Don`t miss your chance- this is excellent.  Keep in mind however, it is sad.  If possible, watch in 1080p.  The animation is breathtaking, and especially amazing considering how short the number of Key Animators and Artists there are.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="206351">Sad like Hoshi no Koe was, but it is beautifully and flawlessly animated. Pretty much every shot looks like it could be a wallpaper. That`s the level of detail that went into this. An absolute masterpiece concerning distances, heartbreak, and regrets.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="198490">... very impressive creation, for those in love in special</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="488006">Very sad with a meaningful message. I had to rewatch it to fully understand it, and suddenly felt a little better. 
A must see for anyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="536175">the best movie I`ve seen so far</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556696">Definitely something worth watching.  It tells us that no matter how much we want something, there are always going to be hindrances along the way. But then, these hindrances would also show us how to move on; to let go but to never forget the people that had been important to us.</recommendation>

<description>This is the story of two close friends, http://anidb.net/ch4062 [Toono Takaki] and http://anidb.net/ch4063 [Shinohara Akari], who became separated by space and time:
Part 1 — The Chosen Cherry Blossoms (26 min.): Because of family relocation, Shinohara Akari had to leave Tokyo after graduating from elementary school. The strong feelings between Takaki and Akari keep them in contact, but they worry that they may not meet again. Then, one day, Takaki learns that his family will move from Tokyo to an island in the far south of Japan, so he decides to use this last chance to visit Akari by train...
Part 2 — Cosmonaut (21 min.): Years have passed, and Takaki still writes emails meant for Akari, only to never send them to her. Meanwhile http://anidb.net/ch7782 [Sumita Kanae], his classmate, has feelings for Takaki, but she does not have the courage to confess her love to him...
Part 3 — 5 Centimetres per Second (16 min., mostly a music clip): Takaki is working as computer programmer now, occasionally remembering his former life — and love. And one day, at a railroad crossing, he suddenly passes by a woman who looks familiar to him...

<name>lonely</name>
<description>Loneliness is an unpleasant feeling in which a person feels a strong sense of emptiness and solitude resulting from inadequate levels of social relationships. However, it is a subjective experience. Loneliness has also been described as social pain — a psychological mechanism meant to alert an individual of isolation and motivate her/him to seek social connections.

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>archery</name>
<description>Archery is the art, practice, or skill of shooting arrows with the use of a bow, from Latin arcus. A person who participates in archery is typically known as an archer.
While archery has been historically used for hunting, both for food and later, in a use that survives to this day, also as a sport, through most of pre-gunpowder human history its main use was for combat; archers were extremely important in warfare, in open field and siege alike, due to their ability to massively kill enemy armies with literal rains of arrows and to set things aflame with burning arrowheads. Proper easy of burning arrowheads could destroy the morale of an invading infantry division or set the entire defending fortress on fire, while non-burning arrowheads could destroy a large portion of the enemy infantry before it could even enter melee combat. Such was the destruction ability of archers that horse archers were the backbone of the both the Hun and Mongol hordes; the former brought terror to and helped the eventual demise of the Roman Empire, while the latter conquered such a large portion of Eurasia that historians coined the term Pax Mongolica (paralleling the Pax Romana) to describe their empire that at its apex spanned from modern-day Poland to the Middle East to Southern China, Korea and the southern parts of Russia.
With the discovery of gunpowder and the invention of firearms, archery was quickly rendered obsolete in warfare. Early firearms were not good in comparison to good archers, with drawbacks such as a vastly inferior rate of fire and high susceptibility to wet weather; nevertheless, they had longer effective range and, most importantly, required almost no practice to use properly in comparison to the many years that it took to train an archer; indeed, a popular saying used to go that "to make a good archer, one must start with his grandfather". Nevertheless, in the Far East archery is to this day considered an important subject in the studies of martial arts, and some Japanese schools have archery dojos ran by archery clubs. Additionally, archery saw an 18th century reemergence as a recreational activity in the West, becoming relevant as an elite class sport, specially for hunting but also at non-living targets, and eventually also becoming an Olympic competition.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>daily life</name>
<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<name>school life</name>
<description>Since a large part of the anime audience still takes part in school life or is visiting college, it is only natural to choose a setting the audience can identify with, be it elementary, middle, or high school. For the older viewers a college setting with more mature real-life problems is appropriate. And since clubs take up so much time in the lives of students, these are obviously also important.</description>

<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<name>promise</name>
<description>A dramatically-made promise that serves as foreshadowing. The promise will eventually be called in and action will be required.
Whether they succeed, fail or refuse to keep their promise depends almost entirely on the idealism-level of the story. Other factors, such as whether they were told what they had to do, or if it was a Leonine Contract, may come into play. Even Releasing from the Promise is usually a scene of high drama.

<name>star-crossed lovers</name>
<description>Two lovers — usually teenagers — destined to be kept apart no matter how hard they struggle to be together. It may be fate or just feuding families, or even something as mundane as a few hundred miles, but something will always be in their way. Often, the two can only be together in death. The phrase is astrological in origin, stemming from the belief that the positions of the stars ruled over people`s fates. To describe a relationship as "star-crossed" is to say that it is "thwarted by a malign star", or that the stars are working against the relationship. Shakespeare`s Romeo and Juliet is the most famous example of this archetype but it dates back at least as far as the ancient Greeks.
"From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, / a pair of star-cross`d lovers, take their life."
- Romeo and Juliet, prologue</description>

<name>season</name>
<description>A season is a division of the year, marked by changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight. Seasons result from the yearly orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth`s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth`s surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.
During May, June, and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January, and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere.
In temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons (with their adjectives) are generally recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal), fall and winter (hibernal). Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.
