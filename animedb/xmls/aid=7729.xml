<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="446359">The best anime ever made, 5 fucking starts!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="96822">Just me, Desire + ever17 = Steinsgate.

ps: gets better after ep 12.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="314849">The show is ok, full of tropes, cliches, and flat characters in a disguise harem setting but if you haven`t seen much and can`t recognize these, then yeah it`s a good show.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="57112">Overrated anime. It starts out quite interesting, but quickly develops into a mundane "repeat the same day over again" story kind of like the movie Run Lola Run. Most of the characters are stereotypes: the tsundere love interest, the moe childhood friend, the overweight otaku/hacker, the shy androgynous character, the overly cute "nyan nyan" character, etc. However, the main character is good, there is above average character development, and for the most part the show is entertaining. However, it had so much more potential than what it became.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="632413">Epic Sci-Fi Anime. Recommended for you..</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="200790">best to be seen on your IBN PC in HD monocrome.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="611299">best story</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="436748">this anime took about 10 episodes to reach me, i really couldn`t understand all the fuss about it until then. now i`m addicted and it`s so awesome, thrilling and original! be patient unitl you reach ep 10 and above to see its full potential, you won`t regret it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="36">Odd cast but the story is incredibly interesting in terms of plot. While the story moves slowly at times, the show doesn`t get quite boring and the plot still manages to keep your attention.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="471928">it was simply awesome i think it was one of the best anime of this season</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="77420">A pretty good anime with 2 distinct phases which are separated at the middle (12 episodes more or less). This could be a great one if not for the stereotypical characterization often found in anime. Still, very worth a watch and I`d recommend watching the first episode again after seeing the whole series just to check how everything connects just right.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="177218">I have to agree! It`s one hella interesting mystery sci-fi series. Kept me glued to my seat on wanting to know what happen next &amp; next etc etc :) Satisfying ending too!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="515855">Totally marvelous design and psychology of characters. Tut-tu-roo!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="672632">Incredible anime adaptation of the visual novel.
Soundtrack is very good and the characters are interesting.
It`s a very sad anime, I think almost every named character cries at least once.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="427701">Pretty good anime IMO. Good mix of plot, storyline, and drama. If you`re watching this you should probably note that it does start a little bit slow and confusing so hang in there until episode 7. I didn`t understand everything about time travel in there but you really don`t need to to appreciate it. Does have a bit of melancholy but it`s not that bad. Really liked it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="366429">Great and dark story about time traveling. The anime is well-made and not just something for fans of the game. Definitely recommended!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="84998">Not bad, but not the best either. Takes a while to really get going, and the last 4 or 5 episodes will drive you crazy if you don`t have a lot of patience for filler scenes and filler dialogue that do nothing to drive the plot. It`s worth the time to watch it, at the very least. If you consider yourself an anime connoisseur, you should probably watch it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="257071">My favourite sci-fi series title to date, hands down. Where Chaos;Head starts strong and goes quickly downhill, Steins;Gate starts slowly and keeps getting better, and better, and even better. A mix of sci-fi, romance, and action that will doubtless leave you wanting more.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="332605">As far as Time Travel story goes, this one works. The story is well constructed: it builds up nicely and it`s ending with satisfactory closure.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="76759">Definitely worth the watch if you`re into well-plotted suspense.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="337356">The phrase in my mind: "post-haruhi". The series holds together quite well, at times funny, at times drama, at times soft sci-fi, rather calmly paced. Nothing that could bend your mind, but still enjoyable. At times too much of a forced certain-community-targetted jokes, but hey, let`s just ignore them [jokes].</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="455194">If you understand a little about this computer stuff the hacking part is just a big *facepalm* (thats what i hate about cyberpunk)
I think it also applies to physicists and the LHC stuff.
But overall it was nice to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="481253">Usually, I don`t like too many jokes, but the balance of humor and seriousness is well put here. Inteligent sci-fi and great plot until now, without mention the excentric Okabe, that will pull out many laughters for sure. All will depend on how they will develop the story from now on, but until now, I recommend you to watch this.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="555738">Seems silly in the beginning, but give it time and it will grow in every way</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="428654">EP 1-11 was kinda slow and boring, imo. 

Very good anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="479971">When I saw the first episode, i thought it will be a bad sci-fi show, but after some time, it started to be a great comedy :) I highly reccomend this :)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="26064">you may be bored at some early eps, but it will be great soon after, totally great storyline, nice chara development, totally recommended</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="228848">Watch this show damn you! Watch it! Get through the first 5-6 episodes but stick through it. Watch it until the very last second of episode 24. What the HELL are you doing still reading this! GO! WATCH IT! NOW!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="522273">This might sound like a broken record but its the best take on time travel EVER!!! And most of the science makes sense. Has everything to make it a 9 point anime. From comedy to light romance and at times serious. Best anime of 2011. Must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="230513">Brilliant show! a "must see" for people who like a great developing story with a awesome climax!

Dp</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="291172">It`s all in there.Food for thought,sci-fi,ever increasing suspense,good comedy sometimes(not mainly comedy) and a tidbit of quality romance.Grade A++ stuff, in a time where most new series go for same ol` boring ,market tested stuff like ecchi or mindless shounen brawling.Must watch even if you`re not into sci-fi.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="262593">Propably one of the best stories out there, one of those where you have to watch the first episode again before the finale, and resultingly have your mind explode about how everything makes sense now. Even the buildup in the first half of the show is very clever with its goofy comedy and colorful characters.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="578744">the first 2 or 3 episodes weren`t good but after than it gets really interesting and it has a satisfying ending</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="620834">It`s nothing like you have experience before. It`s mind blowing, heart wrenching and thrilling all at the same time. And it actually has an original, interesting male protagonist who doesn`t just trigger every flag by just being half-decent.
I ended up sobbing like a little girl by the near-last episodes. The story could have been more epic if it ended with more of a tragic note. But who am I to judge. After I`m done I`ve already felt in love whole-heartedly with the characters that I just couldn`t bear seeing them in any more pain.
See and judge for yourself</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="210645">This should be on everybody`s short list.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="372312">this anime is inspiring
very creative :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="544654">This anime redifines epic. Clearly one of the best works in a while. You should drop whatever you are doing and watch this show NOW if you have not seen it yet.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="473165">you will get a laugh in the first 9 ep and you will cry in the rest . the plot is amazing , the characters background storys are the best , all in all a masterpiece ,abit slow to kick off but totally worth it</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="486670">must see, no words for this anime. I must say that the first twelve episodes don`t make much of a sense and let you a feeling that this anime is not special...BUT from that point and till the end, not only u start to realize that everything that it showed you was important, but so awesome that u will never forget it. Awesome plot, awesome characters, awesome romance...Plus a rare plot with time manipulate mystery and invention. also MUST SEE the 25 episode that was released with blu ray.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="211220">This is something that needs to be seen!! You`ll have to endure first 12 episodes to gather needed info, but then starts the best kind of torture, you live through it side by side with main characters. Amazing story, nice characters! And this is the first time I went through the hassle of writing a recommendation!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="531127">The best anime that I`ve seen in 2012. Seins Gate surprised me, very nice story, funny, a lot of tension and drama, great main characters. Definitly you must to see it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="525522">I honestly tried to watch this series about 3 times in the past year or so; I never got past the 2nd episode. I then watched Chaos;head and really loved the main character and the way the story was told. So, I decided to give Steins;Gate another try. Best decision ever! While its a little slow to get going(about 3 to 4 episodes before things get laid out and a few more episodes before things pick up), it tells one of the best stories in anime. Great story-telling, great plot, amazing characters, perfect character development; there is nothing I`d change about this series. Like I said, the beginning is slow, but everything in it is important and it all makes sense later. Its got clever humor, emotions, some action, and best of all: the dialogue. You won`t regret watching this anime. Do it as soon as you can.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="472569">im in love with this anime, every episode has a shocking thing inside, that makes u to get super excited when the next episode comes out! 
Its fully physics and science
i like it because they wont travel through time because they have god gift powers , they travel by science,, and the anime that happens in our time, makes it more lovable</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281995">You HAVE to love the characters, and the plot just drags you in. Masterpieces reloaded!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="391755">Simply brilliant. Truly a masterpiece!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="518231">One thing...
tu-tu-ruuuuuuuuuuu &amp;lt;3</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="585958">most impressive series of the 2011.
it`s deserve to be called "masterpiece".</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="207370">This is a must-see anime! It`s so brilliant in many ways. The first episodes aren`t that great but they are pretty much required in order to understand the storyline. It`s cool how the plot develops and gets really deep at the end of the anime :).

As for me Steins;Gate provided a lot to think about (the desire to change the past and regretting changing it etc.). I also grew to like the characters a lot. The OST is a masterpiece as well. Steins;Gate really knows how to set you in the mood. I`ll be eagerly waiting for the movie. Do yourself a favor and watch this anime!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="559673">MASTERPIECE!nothing more , nothing less!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="38226">Masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="533655">Don`t judge a book by it`s cover. First episodes will make you think that it`s another harem trash with a stupid (borderline retarded) main character. Here`s the twist: it isn`t. Soon enough you`ll see a nicely done complex story with many interesting plot twists. There aren`t many good animes lately and this turned out astonishingly good. If you`ll ever give it a shot - watch it completely. You won`t regret it. That`s all I can say. El Psy Congroo.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="118817">Great character development and amazing story makes this a must watch for anyone, Once I started watching it grabbed me and never let go. Really enjoyed this and would reccomend it to anyone.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="219037">The first few episodes of this, you can see as the front cover of a book... there is so much more to it     after you start turning the pages.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="556152">This Anime will do anything it can to fuck with your brain, emotions and memories, watch it trough the end and you will experience one of the best anime :) definite must see</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="454583">One of the best anime</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="21092">For a series that can use an aspect much detested in another series (that being a certain 8 episodes from The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi Season 2), and turn it into an intriguing, and harrowing emotional roller-coaster that keeps one engaged until the very end - a truly laudable feat indeed!
Moreover, the production values of this series are very high: with attractive visuals, superb voice acting, and a well balanced, fitting, and memorable sound track (the ED in particular).
Steins Gate will not disappoint those seeking an intense sci-fi drama musing over topics including time travel theories, the butterfly effect, morality, and the bonds of friendship and love - a wide enough range to pique almost anyone`s interest.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="411316">Watched it, loved it. I definitely recommend everyone to watch it. Some might find the first two or so episodes to be slow/dull, but they`re absolutely necessary. It`s what comes after that makes this anime into a masterpiece. Don`t forget to watch the DVD Special ("Episode 25")!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="212957">Funny, heart warming, bizarre, deep, interesting... How the hell did they manage to fit all this and more in one show, and so perfectly...? A must see indeed!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="260637">Omg I cant even explain the awesomeness. I`ll never look at time traveling the same way after this anime. Stop reading and go watch it nowwwwwwww!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="405665">Despite slow and (imo) very confusing start, you begin to slowly put things together.
Then there is a moment of revelation when you think "Oh I get it! Cool!"
Then shit starts to happen all over again and you will be (maybe more) confused once more.
And it all head towards very emotional ending.

Don`t be discouraged by first episodes, it`s well worth the watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="301367">Time-travels, mad scientist, otaku culture, great cast of characters, comedy and much more. Try it and you`ll love it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="430077">A great anime with amazing and well designed characters, a very good choice of VAs and a very strong plot. The beginning focuses more on comedy but slowly it builds up a very deep story focused on time travel and cause &amp; effect. Teaches you what happens when you mess with the past. Interesting and beautiful anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="147092">I agree with the others.  Once the first few eps are done, the story makes a lot more sense and becomes very interesting.  Very original.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="278873">Must watch!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="628007">BEST THING EVER! I don`t even know how to explain how much i loved this anime. I loved the characters, the plot and time travel is always great. Watch it no matter what. Now. Stop reading and do it. You can thank me later.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="97207">You cannot miss this anime. With nail-biting cliff-hangers, adult romance (NOT "Omg we kissed!!! *Noseblood*" childish romance, we`ve seen WAY too much of in anime) and psychological drama, you will love this anime from start to end! If you like anime, and you`re tired of the childish harem/school plots, watch this! Your love for anime will be reignited, it is that good.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="545305">A must see in the true sense of the word. It has a fairly complex plot and by the time it ends you wish it hadn`t.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="727529">if 10/10 implies that an anime deeply touched someone, aside of being perfect in every other way, then this is 11/10. it doesn`t require you to have certain views, memories, it doesn`t require anything from you to resonate with you emotionally other than being human.

brilliant story, emotional roller coaster and a true must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="395002">Before I say anything else - PLEASE get past the first 3-4 episodes! I ended up picking this series up back in 2013 and I couldn`t get past the first episode. I was one of those people who said "Meh" and couldn`t figure out WHY people liked this series so much, when the first few episodes kind of suck and make no sense. SO i put this away in my library never thinking about it until only a week ago. So I watched it, somehow pushed through the confusing and "bleh" beginning and HOLY CRAP. I can easily say, this is one of the BEST anime I`ve ever seen. Again, please get past the confusing intro PLEASE! Don`t be like me and miss out on one of the greats. By the time I finished it.. I wish it hadn`t. Its THAT GOOD!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="469392">If you are looking for an amazing anime, this is you call. You get in it from the first episode of this master piece.
A perfect combination of comedy, romance, thriller and much more. Also remember to watch the special episode :D</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="558578">Kinda Got bored at this at the earlier episodes, but it got interesting during half part of the show, reminds of the american Movie  The Butterfly Effect</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="373701">One of the best animes of all times certainly !
The songs, the characters, the story will forever be in my mind, through the time lines.

It`s a masterpiece that everyone should watch.</recommendation>

<recommendation type="Must See" uid="526839">The best take on time travel ever. Ingenious plot, hilarious dialogue, and everything that makes a good anime. That`s all I have to say, now GO WATCH THIS!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="239305">awesome daily life sci-fi mad scientist combination that get`s you thinking

more targeted to mature viewers and content gets harder to follow 

for real fans or you want more after the ending, play the visual novel!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="178631">pure awesomeness.
Definitely for sci-fi fans and for mind-twisting plot for everyone else.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="360204">Some people describe this series as having a slow start, but don`t let that turn you off.  I was worried before I started the show, but now I really disagree about the slow start.  Even from the very first episode you can already tell that there`s some weird stuff (in a good way) going on, even without knowing the premise of the show beforehand.

If you`ve heard of this, if you`re interested, start on it today.  You will be glad you did.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="162486">One of the best anime of this season.</recommendation>

It starts like some lame comedy but as the story progress it becomes better and better and BETTER.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="392207">definitely BEST SHOW of THE SEASON.... it`s dark, complex, sometimes funny... at the end of every episode makes me say "WTF? End already?" and makes me really really longing for the next episode... really addictive... what? haven`t watch it? then WATCH IT!!! It really MORE THAN WORTH of your time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="417666">This is one of the few VERY GOOD anime series I have seen so far. I recommend it to everyone. It has a very satisfying and logical plot on time travel subject. With the good story telling and animation quality, it`s a must see in my opinion.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="302304">best characters evar</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="424773">This anime is simply amazing! This anime is completely different from the other anime that you might expect. Instead of fantasy-based, it`s science. Lots of science and the storyline is amazing. Each episode passing by wants you to watch the next and it`s cool how they do that. So this anime is a must-see, especially if you`re a fan of Chaos;Head. ^^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="135971">I just could not stop watching one episode after the other. Brilliant plot like a stack.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="366535">One of the best anime of the season! This is 99% science and 1% fiction! If you think about all that they say, it has lots of sense! It is not that they travel because "god wants" or "they have THE power"...It is logic!!! You MUST SEE!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="207137">In one word - awesome.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="515136">OKEEEEEEEEE this is the best anime for me (actually not just this), so i really recommended this even the protagonist little annoying first but in eps.12+ he`s very cool, oh yeah the romance is very touching too, and this is anime that can make my little heart crying :D. Oh yeah don`t hesitate to watch this anime because a fuc**ng thread below</recommendation>

<description>* Based on a visual novel by http://anidb.net/cr1334 [5pb] and http://anidb.net/cr1354 [Nitroplus].
In Akihabara a group of friends have managed to customize their microwave into a device that can send text messages into the past. As they perform different experiments, an organization named http://anidb.net/ch38123 [SERN] who has been doing their own research on time travel tracks them down and now the friends have to find a way to avoid being captured by them.
Note: The first episode received a preview screening in Tokyo on Sunday, March 6, 2011. Participants were chosen through an email lottery held until Monday, February 28. Two other preview screenings were held in Aichi, Nagoya`s Gamers branch on Saturday, March 12 and Osaka, Namba`s Gamers branch on Sunday, March 13. Tickets for those two events were given out to people who pre-ordered and paid either the opening or ending single. The regular television broadcast started on April 6, 2011.</description>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<name>paranoia</name>
<description>Paranoia is a thought process believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of irrationality and delusion. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs, or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself. Paranoia is distinct from phobias, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame. Making false accusations and the general distrust of others also frequently accompany paranoia. For example, an incident most people would view as an accident or coincidence, a paranoid person might believe was intentional.

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>An anime that takes place in an alternative past is an anime that clearly does not belong to the future or the present, and isn`t tied particularly closely to our history, or has ties to our history but only as a premise: there are too many things that don`t make sense for the time-period. In some cases there is futuristic technology present, but the overall setting still feels that of the past. However the setting must still take place on Earth, since we can not know if the history of a fantasy world is an alternate one or not. </description>

Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō, "Eastern Capital") is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the centre of the Greater Tokyo Area, and the largest metropolitan area of the world. It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace, and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family. Tokyo is in the Kantou region on the south-eastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi).

<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<description>The thriller is a genre of fiction in which tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the free world. The hero of a typical thriller faces danger alone or in the company of a small band of companions. The protagonist may be a law enforcement agent, a journalist, or a soldier, but typically he or she is cut off from the resources of "their" organization. More often the hero is an ordinary citizen drawn into danger and intrigue by circumstances beyond their control. (Source: Wikipedia)</description>

<name>harem</name>
<description>Harem is an entertainment-related trope which is characterized by three or more characters, normally female, who for some reason are in the presence and under the influence of one character, generally male, according to a few genre-defining guidelines; here it will be assumed, for simplicity of language, that the harem lead is a male character and the members are female characters. Though that is the rule, there are exceptions; a story in which there is one female character and several male characters is normally called a "http://anidb.net/t2792 [reverse harem]", or sometimes also "male harem". Aside from the swapping of the characters` genders, the trope`s details are mostly the same, with the majority of the changes relating to the differences in behavior between men and women of the characters` age range. It is also possible to create harems with homosexual relationships, again with very few changes to the main antics themselves. The harem may not have more than only one lead, as that would be a love polygon, or less than three members, as one would form a couple and two would make a love triangle.
As a defining rule of harem, the interactions between the lead and each of the individual members are filled with romantically or sexually loaded content, either implicitly, through innuendo or subtext, or explicitly, through text or actions, and those actions are a key plot element. Generally, the female characters` looks and personalities will vary a lot among the ones present in one single series, but quite rarely will they actually differ from the common stock archetypes, which are known, well-defined, and easy to copy; for this reason, the genre as a whole is often considered repetitive. Usually, the characters involved directly in this trope are in the late teenager to young adult age range, but that is not mandatory. Sexually charged behavior on the lead`s part pretty much can`t be avoided, and it`s typical to see him stamped as a pervert by some or all of the members, regardless of whether he is one; the sexual tones also applies to the depiction of the harem members, often leading the genre to labeled sexist. The lead will often suffer very violent retribution for his behavior, which has attracted criticism of gratuitous violence as well.
Most of the harem members will be romantically or sometimes sexually interested in the one male character, and in him alone; that, however, is not an absolute rule, and indeed sometimes none of the female characters are really interested at first, so the protagonist has to build relationships with them from scratch. That idea comes in large part from visual novels; it is quite common for visual novels to revolve around controlling the male lead and have him build relationships with either as many female characters as possible or with one of them, the latter being more common for visual novels with branched story paths; a large portion of those visual novels also feature erotic content, which may be hard to adapt to TV series. It may be also possible that the harem is only a support to the existing or predictable relationship between the lead and the most important member; additionally, the lead may end up in relationships with most or all of the harem members, with the agreement of all, in a setting normally called "harem ending".</description>

The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top".</description>

<description>A dystopia (from Ancient Greek: δυσ-, "bad, ill", and Ancient Greek: τόπος, "place, landscape"; alternatively cacotopia, or anti-utopia) is, in literature, an often futuristic society that has degraded into a repressive and controlled state, often under the guise of being utopian. Dystopian literature has underlying cautionary tones, warning society that if we continue to live how we do, this will be the consequence. A dystopia, thus, is regarded as a sort of negative utopia and is often characterized by an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government. Dystopias usually feature different kinds of repressive social control systems, a lack or total absence of individual freedoms and expressions and constant states of warfare or violence. Dystopias often explore the concept of humans abusing technology and how humans individually and collectively cope with technology that has evolved too quickly such as the car, the flamethrower or the microwave. A dystopian society is also often characterized by widespread poverty and brutal political controls such as a large military-like police.</description>

<description>Usually metaphorical. Sometimes literal. At times both!
Typically this refers to the fact that the story is set in a grim, dog eat dog milieu — for example a decaying city.
Often the characters are just doing what they need to do to survive, with little or no expectation that their lives can be better. And often characters may feel they do not have any real choice in what they do.
And yes, occasionally the setting is actually dark — be it night or perpetually heavy cloudy sky and rain. It all adds to the oppressive, hopeless feeling of the show.
You probably will not feel uplifted or happy after watching this anime.</description>

<description>A `mind fuck` is a slang term which describes a work that uses literary devices such as nonlinear storytelling and plot twists in order to present convoluted, yet not conflicting, themes.
A creation is usually considered a mind fuck when a casual observer is not able to discern the true meaning of a work without making a serious attempt to unravel the themes presented or when the plot is incredibly difficult to follow.
Special examples of mind fucks involve a single plot twist which completely changes the viewer`s understanding of the events in a film or novel as well as the ideas it presents.</description>

<name>cosplay restaurant</name>
<description>Cosplay restaurants are theme restaurants and pubs that originated in Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan around the year 1999. They include maid cafés and butler cafés, where the service staff dress as elegant maids, or as butlers. Such restaurants and cafés have quickly become a staple of Japanese otaku culture. Compared with service at normal cafés, the service at cosplay cafés involves the creation of a rather different atmosphere. The staff treat the customers as masters and mistresses in a private home rather than merely as café customers.
The popularity of the cosplay restaurants and maid cafés has spread to other regions in Japan, such as Osaka`s Den Den Town as well as other countries, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Mexico, and Canada.
Often such cafés or a more simple kissaten, small Japanese-style coffee shops, are part of school festivals where the protagonists` class runs one.</description>

<description>Engrish is actually a mispronunciation of English, as can be the result of someone, who does not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English, the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary language.</description>

<name>time loop</name>
<description>A time loop is a common plot device in science fiction (especially in universes where time travel is commonplace). Events in the story repeat themselves a number of times with or without some variation with each pass. Most characters either do not realise this is occurring or are attempting to break the cycle in some way. 
One well-known example of this is in the 1993 film Groundhog Day, in which the main character is the only one aware of the time loop, although time loops had appeared in many fictional works prior to that. Stories with time loops commonly center on correcting past mistakes or on getting a character to recognise some key truth; escape from the loop may then follow.</description>

<name>just as planned</name>
<description>A term usually used to describe a situation, where a seemingly smart and cunning villain sets up a plan that seems grand and impressive, but is actually long winding, ridiculous, and convoluted. And all of that just to trick his opponent(s), like the hero or anybody else, into doing things exactly as he planned. Suffice to say that the villain could have reached his goal by much shorter and easier means, it just wouldn`t seem as awesome anymore.
The phrase is also known as the original Japanese "keikaku doori" where keikaku stands translated for "plan" or "schedule", and doori for "in accordance with ..." or "following ...".
The phrase is a reference to http://anidb.net/ch301 [Yagami Light] from http://anidb.net/a4563 [Death Note], and his love for plans.</description>

<name>the power of love</name>
<description>The power of love is not only the strongest power known to mankind, it is the strongest power in the universe. The power of love conquers all things. It makes people cry, it makes people laugh, it can make them sing and occasionally it even brings dead people back to life, just so.
More so than the power of friendship, the power of true love gives boundless strength and resolution; by the power of love every hardship can be overcome, every issue can be resolved and it does make people resistant to food poisoning (caused by the bad cooking of their loved ones). Even the big bad evil doesn`t stand a chance against the power of true love and often ends up redeemed.
Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set so that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible".</description>

He also talks to himself on the cellphone, his words not making much sense. Supposedly, he has very few friends that can understand what he`s talking about.
Often calls himself "Hououin Kyouma" (鳳凰院凶真).
Mayuri and Daru just call him "Okarin" (オカリン), abbreviated after his name.
The phrase he uses to end conversations, particularly with himself, is "El Psy Kongroo"
(エル・プサイ・コングルゥ).</description>

Plenty of statements he makes could be taken as sexual harassment. He and Rintarou have known each other since high school. Usually turns down Rintarou`s ridiculous requests as "annoying", but in truth gets them done in proper order. However, he trusts Rintarou as a friend. Has great confidence in his programming and hacking abilities (he doesn`t mind being called a Super Hacker, but doesn`t like it when people call him Super Haker). He`s always in front of the computer.
Has the nickname "Daru" (ダル), abbreviated after his name.</description>

Rintarou makes him out to be his student on his own, and is currently in the middle of brainwashing him. A very shy person, he often turns down Mayuri`s requests to cosplay.</description>

<description>A research member in Victor Qondria University`s Brain Research Program (age group matches that of third-year high school, but skipped a grade through America`s educational system). She is famous in America for writing thesis papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She doesn`t like to show weakness to others and so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious and when she builds interest she pokes into things. Occassionally has views that differ from regular opinion, like, "The experiment data is more important than the subject`s privacy." Rintarou often tells her, "Hey, you`ve got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist", but she`s not one to agree to such things personally.
Rintarou has given her plenty of nicknames, in particular "Christina" (クリスティーナ) and "Assistant" (助手).</description>

A little too familiar with things, but doesn`t dig too deep. Not quite comfortable with having other people help her. For that reason, she spends as little time as possible. Her personality drastically changes when it comes to her own interests. Proactive. Has a habit of using strange and difficult vocabulary at times, but somehow you can tell she`s purposely doing so. Ended up hanging out with the Future Gadget Laboratory since she started working at the CRT TV Workshop.</description>
