<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="527839">Not as good as the original in terms of plot.  It drags on at times and the protagonist isn`t as relatable this time around.  Aside from Tohsaka and Archer, the other characters aren`t as well fleshed out.  This series is mainly focused on Shiroe`s ambitions, but he lacks personality.

The art style is amazing though!

The original series is still my favourite, followed by Fate/Zero, and finally this.  That said, it is watchable and ends well-enough at least.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="314254">It is very good anime in general, but in term of top anime it is not too good. There is too much talking and that is main reason why UBW is noticeably worse than Fate / Zero (which is real masterpiece). Still very good anime and for Fate fans must see.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="586959">Superb animation probabaly the best of year if i do say so myself, story is ok-ish, characters are fantastic and this route is much better than the fate one</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="498162">Epic, story completed nicely!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="173070">This review will be for all 25 episodes as I feel it is the most appropriate to review it this way.

I poured my heart and soul into this review, but apparently there was too much heart and soul as it gave me an error and deleted my post.

In spite of that, I will say that this series was something that started out much like the original series did. After 4-5episodes, this is where it starts to diverge. 

This series excelled in one particular area to me: Character development. In my mind, if there is a character which is stagnant and never changes, they`re nothing more than a prop. However, when a character grows and you root for him to grow more, then you know you`re hooked.

With the added benefit of having an epilogue episode that wraps up "What is this character going to do next?" neatly, this is something that is rarely in animes. It was... a wonderful feeling to have it end that way.</recommendation>

<description>* Based on the second route of the Fate/Stay Night erotic visual novel by http://anidb.net/cr927 [Type-Moon].
Now that http://anidb.net/ch1910 [Caster] has become the most difficult contender among the six remaining Servants from those summoned into the 5th Holy Grail War, allied Masters http://anidb.net/ch1904 [Emiya Shirou] and http://anidb.net/ch241 [Toosaka Rin] face a dire situation. Desperate for a way to fortify their position, and with their backs against the wall, they seek to forge a temporary alliance with http://anidb.net/ch1913 [Illyasviel von Einzbern], someone they would previously never consider allying with. Meanwhile, however, http://anidb.net/ch1914 [Matou Shinji] has not forfeited his rights as a Master simply because he lost http://anidb.net/ch1909 [Rider], and has since forged a contract with http://anidb.net/ch1912 [another Servant]; like Shirou and Rin, this Servant, who isn`t one to wait for his Master to order him around, also holds a direct interest in http://anidb.net/ch1907 [Berserker]`s Master, albeit for different reasons. In this permanently chaotic power rearrangement, in this fragile, easily shifting power balance, a shadow of betrayal constantly looms above, and trust is not to be found; alliances and contracts are easily broken, those who are swayed one way by the circumstances may well be swayed another way later, and those who find new pawns for themselves must be wary of becoming pawns themselves, perhaps even of their own pawns.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>erotic game</name>
<description>An erotic game (eroge) is a Japanese video or computer game that features erotic content, usually in the form of anime-style artwork. In English, eroge are often called hentai games in keeping with the English slang definition of hentai. This is sometimes shortened to H games. In Japan, eroge are also referred to as 18+ games. Most erotic games are visual novels or dating sims but are not limited to them.
Any anime adaptation of a game that contains (or had a version that contains) adult content (generally sex scenes), regardless of how some fanboys blabber on how "the story in that visual novel was too good to be labelled as porn!", should definitely get this category added under them. This should make it pretty clear as to what is an erotic game and what is not.</description>

<name>visual novel</name>
<description>The two terms are similar yet different, however, the fact that they look and `feel` the same outweighs the technical differences. For clarification, visual novels are considered a sub-genre of adventure games and the term does not cover simulations. While the two genres often share a common visual presentation, dating sims are sometimes considered to be more statistically based than the "choose your own adventure" style of visual novels; basically, the choices you make might change something else than just the story arc (or your next porn pic). Dating sims can involve several technical elements such as a time limit, several statistics such as looks and charm which can be boosted through exercise, or an "attraction meter" which can increase or decrease depending on one`s decisions.</description>

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>Saber, an agile and powerful warrior. Known as the King of Knights, she maintains a high code of honour. Saber is loyal, independent, and reserved; she appears cold, but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Her class is considered the "Most Outstanding", with excellent ratings in all categories.
In Fate/Zero, though she and Emiya Kiritsugu are Servant and Master seeking the same ultimate goal of peace, their differing ideological perspectives result in a strained relationship where Kiritsugu does not directly acknowledge Saber. After Kiritsugu summoned Saber, he made Irisviel hide Avalon - which had served as a catalyst to the summoning - inside her body so to serve as insurance while she performed her act of fake Master. Irisviel`s and Saber`s role at the time was to openly take action and serve as a decoy in order to lure out enemies, while Kiritsugu worked in the shadows with his assistant, Hisau Maiya. Because Saber could not dematerialise her spiritual body, she disguised herself as a man while staying at Irisviel`s side.
In the Fate route, because her master Emiya Shirou cannot effectively provide her with Mana, she minimises her activity to preserve what she has. Saber is bewildered by Shirou`s "protective" tendencies, and believes his erratic and reckless behaviour jeopardise her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.</description>

<gender>female</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Toosaka Rin is a model student and idol of Shirou`s school, Rin is secretly a sorceress and Master in the Holy Grail War. She is descended from a long line of sorcerers, and though lacking a formal magic education, is extremely powerful in her own right. Her father was killed in the 4th Holy Grail War, and she has trained since his death to succeed him. She is perceptive, resourceful and avidly competitive. Although she tried to summon a Saber-class Servant, she accidentally called Archer instead.
Rin excels in transformation of energy, which includes storage of Mana in objects. She stores all of her mana in jewels that she charges daily to bypass her body`s natural limitations on releasing energy. She can detonate her jewels on contact with an object, resulting in a release of energy equivalent to an attack rank of "A". Her most common offensive spell is "Gandr", which fires concentrated mana in the form of a black orb from her finger. On contact, the spell amplifies physical conditions -- a person who is already sick, for example, becomes far sicker upon being hit. Rin is also proficient with reinforcement sorcery, which she uses on her legs to give herself more speed.

He has some slight proficiency with reinforcement sorcery, though his foster father http://anidb.net/ch1919 [Emiya Kiritsugu] did not encourage him to improve it. Initially, he is confused about the Holy Grail War and irrationally attempts to shield others, even his own servant Saber, from danger.</description>

<gender>male</gender>
<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>He is the Servant of one of the series` main heroines, Toosaka Rin. Archer is sarcastic and cynical - but under his hardened exterior lies a complex and dark personality that unfolds throughout the story. Though skilled with ranged weapons, he can hold his own in melee combat. Archer considers Shirou Emiya`s idealism to be weak and delusional, recognising Shirou`s mentality of "wanting to save everyone" as naïve and impossible.
Archer is actually an older version of Emiya Shirou, who actually became a heroic spirit in his own right in the future. Embittered and betrayed by his ideals, he participates in the Holy Grail War in an opportunity to kill his past self and in the ensuing paradox free himself from the path which led to his betrayal.</description>

After Kiritsugu died, Taiga became Shirou`s guardian and has been living with him for several years. Taiga and Shirou are very close, and she regards him as a younger brother.
Taiga is largely a comic relief character; she is irresponsible, clumsy, and prone to sporadic bouts of extreme lethargy or zest. She lives with Shirou under the pretences of being his caretaker, although she cannot cook and lacks many other domestic skills, relying on Shirou to maintain her welfare. Shirou, however, appreciates Taiga`s company, and is more than happy to care for her. When Shirou is in any need of advice, Taiga can be depended on to be a confidante for his worries.</description>

<description>A trans-national, self-preservative organisation created by western magi for the purpose of controlling, concealing and developing Magecraft. Founded around the Middle Ages by those who foresaw the decline of Magecraft, they decided that in order to preserve their power Thaumaturgy should drift apart from society and become a secret known only by a necessary minimum number of people.
It has many laboratories and research bodies that seek to advance the progress of Thaumaturgy, as well as institutions that transmit their secrets to the next generation. Although the emphasis lies on the pursuit of knowledge, the Association also seeks to increase its own military strength so it can defend itself against those that might threaten it, such as the Holy Church, other mystic organizations and supernatural forces seeking punish mankind for meddling with areas that should not be touched.
The Mage`s Association is currently headquartered at the Clock Tower in London.</description>

<description>The Holy Church, also referred simply as "the Church", is a worldwide religious organisation, apparently styled after the real Roman Catholic Church. It is a powerful faction in the Nasuverse, with several important characters in the `verse works being its active or former members. On the surface, they coexist rather peacefully with the http://anidb.net/ch1951 [Mage`s Association], but that is only out of necessity, and neither group will waste an opportunity to backstab the other. They sometimes act as arbiters in the Association`s internal disputes; one such example are the Holy Grail Wars. Aside their regular duties as a normal religious group, they have a few special agencies dedicated to supernatural events.
The Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament, the lowest among the Church`s special agencies, is charged with researching, recovering and managing Holy Relics, items considered to have the holy attribute, scattered around the world. Their name comes from the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church. As the Holy Grail is a Holy Relic, they`re in charge of managing every Holy Grail that appears; as such, in order to watch over the Holy Grail War, the priest stationed at Fuyuki City is always a member of this agency and is the one who acts as the war`s Supervisor.
The Church is also very active and relentless in the pursue and elimination of heretics, beings acting in disagreement with the Holy Scriptures. The members of the Church in that line of work are called Executors, and their specialties include magus hunting, demon killing, and vampire slaying. Among them, the most powerful ones are members of the Burial Agency, a group always composed of eight Executors, one of whom is the leader and another of whom is not an acting member, but a backup. Members of the Burial Agency work alone, and they will act without orders if they deem necessary, even going as far as skewering bishops, which earned them the reputation of the most heretic group inside the Church.
Among the items the Holy Church uses for its purposes, one can find the many types of Keys of Providence, Conceptual Weapons used for purification, and the Holy Scriptures, very powerful Conceptual Weapons used only by a few select Executors. Examples of Keys of Providence are http://anidb.net/ch1916 [Kotomine Kirei]`s most used weapons, the Black Keys, sword-shaped items that can be thrown at an opponent in order to pierce them and that do not have a blade when inside the priest`s frock. An example of a Holy Scripture is the Seventh Holy Scripture, used by http://anidb.net/ch1941 [Ciel], a massive metal weapon which can kill a vampire through physical power alone, shoots Bible pages, has an unicorn horn for a bayonet, and has a http://anidb.net/ch31725 [residing spirit].</description>

<description>Luviagelita or simply Luvia is a wealthy and proud young woman and sorceress.
In Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya she is assigned to work together with Rin to capture the Class Cards. After Sapphire abandons her, Luvia immediately adopts Sapphire`s new master, Miyu, and guides her to capture the Class Cards. She is indiscriminate in using her wealth, erecting a mansion across the street from Einzbern house in a single day, where she and Miyu are currently living. Her rivalry with Rin stems from their mutual crush on Shirou, who fails to notice their attraction to him
