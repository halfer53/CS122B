<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="63624">Definitely better than Fate/Stay Night.
A good serie enjoyable even if you`re not a fan</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="210496">This show will be confusing and convoluted if you are not a typemoon fag. If you are one, this is a must see. Everything lives up to, if not exceeds, expectations.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="378121">Fate/Zero &amp;gt; Fate/Stay Night!!
must watch if ur a fan!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="505941">NOTE: this is for both seasons combined, and I did play all of f/sn VN. I didn`t watch the f/sn anime.

As an anime, I think f/z really fell short. Poor juxtaposition of exposition/philosophy and battle scenes, pacing was a little off, and there was far too much background that was explained far too little. For anybody who didn`t take in f/sn prior to watching f/z, this will be a rather unremarkable experience that feels too heavy on battle scenes and not enough on plot.

As a prequel to F/sn though, I think f/z did a good job of showing the backstory of some of f/sn`s most important figures, notably kiritsugu and kirei. If you`ve already played f/sn, then f/z takes on a whole new dimension. if nothing else, it was an interesting watch. It`s not for anybody who didn`t enjoy f/sn, but for those who did, I`d recommend it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="367615">Cool premise, interesting characters, great animation/effects. It does a decent job of explaining characters` motivations at the emotional/psychological level. BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. This whole season only introduces dozens of characters, and they just exchange greetings and argue.

Feels more like a fanservice series for fans of the franchise. Or if you don`t mind lack of plot.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="379231">I don`t agree with who said its for fan or that you need to be typemoon fan/watcher , The anime by itself explain the whole plot for you to understand why you are watching. In general its one of the best if not the best of this season.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="41626">Haven`t watched the other Fate series but this one is just awesome. Watched all 13 eps in one session xD</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="547924">I liked this much, much more than original show. No "usual Japanese schoolboys", decent set of Masters and Servants, deep understanding of familiar characters.
And, of course, visual part is done well. Amazing and detailed battles and Saber`s invisible sword is FINALLY INVISIBLE!
Must see for all Fate fans.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="276171">Fate/Zero has a completely different feeling than Fate/Stay Night. Even the heaviest route "Heaven`s Feel" in FSN is nothing compared to FZ.

A masterpiece, you must see, whether you like anime or not.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="468675">a delight for the eyes (both this and the sequel).
the visual effects really make this series worth.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="281995">In all the technical aspects, this series is outstanding without a doubt. Plotwise it felt somewhat weak. The dialogues are definitely interesting and there is very good character developement for a couple of them, but the rest of the characters just felt like fillers with little to no purpose, with a seemingly well defined background, but with no developement after that. I liked it, but I enjoyed the original a lot more.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="147722">great action and animation</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="569897">Super awesome. I liked the characters in Fate/Stay Night more, though.
Really pretty, really epic fights. /win</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="442226">This is a great show to watch. I was hesitant at first, because Fate/Stay Night did not impress me, but Fate/Zero is rather interesting to watch. The BD version is pleasing to watch. UTW did a great job with the subtitles as well. Overall, it`s no waste of time.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="257071">There are some who would disagree with me, but I honestly enjoyed this even more than the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, which was in turn far better than the F/SN anime. It`s simply amazing. The only disappointing aspect to this series is that it`s written in such a way that you really have to have experienced the F/SN story to follow certain parts, and because of that I can`t in good faith list this as a must-see. Very highly recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="536019">I must admit this prequel is much better than the original. I think the plot is deeper, there is more action, and overall it`s just better.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="135233">Definitely a must-see. Although, it is strongly advised that you play the Fate/Stay Night Visual Novel (just skip the anime and movie, they are tard).
Reason being is because this anime was primarily targeted at fans of F/SN VN. So from the beginning, you`re expected to already know a lot of info about the world of magi and the Holy Grail War.

As for this series itself, great action, great animation, great voice acting, great pace of story progression and great cast of masters and servants. Definitely superior to Fate/Stay Night.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="521497">Much more better than Fate/Stay Night. The battle scene or even normal scene is really good, the flow of story is easy to understand even if ure not fan of fate series.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="447833">It has a good buildup between Servant and Master, particularly in the case of Saber and Caster. Another to be mentioned would of course be Rider and Waver. The fools of the bunch, but ultimately enjoyable to watch.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="1057">Watch season two for the conclusion. It gets far, far better.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="331735">It`s Fate, so there is litte to say aganist of it. Yes, it can get dense sometimes, but it`s all part of the story, and if you`re lazy to read the novels, you will enjoy the anime.

Plus, it`s available everywhere (including legal worldwide streams in a ton of languages), so you have ZERO excuse to not watch it :)

PROTIP: Play (or watch) F/SN first (which is another must-see/play), otherwise you may feel a bit lost. But even Type-Moon novices will have a good ride with F/Z.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="490197">The animation quality is certainly one of the best I`ve ever seen. The story has a completely different vibe to it than FSN. It`s more serious, without generic shounen idealisms. Don`t miss this one</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="132172">Masterpiece of animation, drawing, action and character psychology.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="71577">It mostly depicts the preparations for the final clash ("second season", or rather just second part) - how it all began, relationships, philosophical question - so it`s the less action driven part. Better than FSN (though you should watch that first even though this is the chronological prequel) and the best thing is that the second season/part (2012) is even more awesome.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="114511">Imagine someone`s handing you a briefcase full of money. No catch. Not giving this a chance is as stupid as not taking the money.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="379739">Judging from the first episode it is definitely must see.
But beware: heavy spoilers, especially if you didn`t play F/SN till the end.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="481845">If u haven`t read the novel, u should watch this anime. If u have read it, u MUST watch this!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="23892">You must see it!!! ^_^</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="494562">Alexander the Great, Iskander, Rider is a Real King Must See</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="275484">One of the best anime ever seen so far. each episode has a plot twister.
were u deceived by FSN? well this one has nothing of the typical shounen `i wanna save the world` idiocy. 
btw, i was able to hook different ppl to it (both boy and girl):
those who never watched anime cause they dont like it, those who dont watch mainstream cause its a pain to wait every week.
a must see, and ur fav character might not even be Saber ;)</recommendation>

<description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr2442 [Urobuchi Gen] and http://anidb.net/cr927 [Type-Moon]`s 2006-2007 Fate/Zero novel, a prequel to Type-Moon`s much acclaimed Fate/Stay Night 2004 visual novel.
The Holy Grail War is a death-match between 7 magi (Masters) and their summoned heroic spirits (Servants). In this battle royale, the prize is the legendary Holy Grail, said to be an omnipotent wish-granting device which will produce any sort of miracle in order to bend reality to accommodate the wishes it grants. The winning Master and Servant shall be granted one wish each, after which the Holy Grail will not be activated until the next War.
The 4th Holy Grail War is about to take place, and the 3 preceding Wars had ended without a victor. In pursuit of their individual goals and ambitions, the competing magi congregate at a Japanese city called Fuyuki. All the magi will do anything, rationalize away any atrocity, in pursuit of the Holy Grail. All of them, but one.
http://anidb.net/ch1916 [Kotomine Kirei] is a Master, but one without a reason to fight. Unable to release himself from the threads of Fate, he is reluctantly drawn into the War. To enter the War, he even had to stray from his path in the Holy Church and join the ranks of the Mage`s Association, an organization with which the Church is not on good terms, but which it has to tolerate and sometimes even cooperate with.
However, as Fate would ironically have it, one of his rival Masters, http://anidb.net/ch1919 [Emiya Kiritsugu], is a man more merciless than anyone else, an assassin who killed many people and intervened in many conflicts, for reasons no one is able to understand. Kirei`s fight against this interesting yet strange sort of enemy might prove to be his most troubling task so far. Kiritsugu is equally puzzled by Kirei, and both of them still have the other Masters and Servants to take care of.

<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.</description>

<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

<name>fetishes</name>
<description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows. </description>

<name>calling your attacks</name>
<description>"GIGAAAAAA DRIIIIIILLL BREAKEEEEEERRR"
If you can do something more impressive than just throw a punch, your attack(s) must have an equally impressive name. More than that, you have to call it out as you launch the attack. It doesn`t matter if it`s a martial arts move, a magical spell or your secret superweapon, if you can`t say its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective.
Having a special attack is always a must, but not impressive enough. Every special attack needs a name. A really awesome and outstanding name which is easy to remember and even easier and impressive to yell. Because it just is not enough to name your attack. No, to unleash the full power of your attack, you have to call its name in your most MANLY and LOUDEST voice.
It does not matter whether it is a martial arts move, a magical spell or flying drills from your mecha, if you can`t call its name, it just isn`t nearly as cool or effective. Not a requirement but wearing shades while calling your attack makes it at least twice as cool, moreover giving your mecha or magical companion shades too results in an immeasurable level of awesomeness, bringing down every enemy just through the POWER OF YOUR VOICE.
A standard feature of practically every mecha, mahou shoujo, high fantasy, or martial arts anime.

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<name>contemporary fantasy</name>
<description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus, C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S. Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes.

<name>magic circles</name>
<description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for non-magical work such as meditation.
Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

<name>fantasy</name>
<description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

<description>The long-term plot of the program revolves around a group of characters whose numbers are being slowly whittled away by one means or another, usually by killing each other. In the case of some reality shows, this is a process of elimination intended to result in a single winner. In other shows, this is a dramatic device, designed to generate tension and conflict with which to drive the overall plot of an episode or Story Arc (if any); in these cases it is sometimes combined with Anyone Can Die to especially heighten the resulting excitement, even when the apparent main character may be protected by Contractual Immortality. Compare Gotta Kill Them All.
Named for one of the catchphrases that came out of the Highlander franchise.

<description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

<name>translation convention</name>
<description>When a group of people whose native language is not Japanese (replace with any other language) are together, away from any Japanese speakers, the audience may nonetheless hear them speaking perfect Japanese.
This is not a case of translator microbes, in which an in-universe device is performing actual translation: We are meant to assume that the characters are really speaking their own native tongue, and it is being translated purely for our benefit.
It is not strictly necessary for there to be no Japanese speakers about; we can sometimes infer from context that they too are speaking a different language. In such cases, it can be difficult (or almost impossible) to tell whether it is the translation convention or translator microbes at work.
In some cases, the actors will begin speaking in the characters` native language, then perform a switch-over to Japanese. This is usually accompanied by some sort of camera-move to cue the audience in to the fact that the characters should still be assumed to be speaking in their native language. Also common is characters speaking their own language when addressing Japanese-speaking members of the cast, but accented Japanese at all other times, giving the curious impression that foreigners only speak their own language when they think an Japanese speaker is listening.
If done in poor taste, the characters may retain ridiculous accents, resulting in giving the impression that they have no other language.

<name>incomplete story</name>
<description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely, leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in movies.</description>

<description>Saber, an agile and powerful warrior. Known as the King of Knights, she maintains a high code of honour. Saber is loyal, independent, and reserved; she appears cold, but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Her class is considered the "Most Outstanding", with excellent ratings in all categories.
In Fate/Zero, though she and Emiya Kiritsugu are Servant and Master seeking the same ultimate goal of peace, their differing ideological perspectives result in a strained relationship where Kiritsugu does not directly acknowledge Saber. After Kiritsugu summoned Saber, he made Irisviel hide Avalon - which had served as a catalyst to the summoning - inside her body so to serve as insurance while she performed her act of fake Master. Irisviel`s and Saber`s role at the time was to openly take action and serve as a decoy in order to lure out enemies, while Kiritsugu worked in the shadows with his assistant, Hisau Maiya. Because Saber could not dematerialise her spiritual body, she disguised herself as a man while staying at Irisviel`s side.
In the Fate route, because her master Emiya Shirou cannot effectively provide her with Mana, she minimises her activity to preserve what she has. Saber is bewildered by Shirou`s "protective" tendencies, and believes his erratic and reckless behaviour jeopardise her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.</description>

<description>Aozaki Touko is a very powerful magus who specializes in puppet making and runs a business called Garan no Dou, literally meaning Hall of Monastery. The business is de jure a design agency that sells its work (mostly architectural work) to whoever is interested, but the agency`s good taste is debatable and http://anidb.net/ch1889 [Kokutou Mikiya] believes that Touko is simply forcing what she wants to make onto the customers. As the design company officially only consists of herself and Mikiya, she is the sole designer while Mikiya takes the job of her secretary. However, the design work is partly a cover to its de facto job, which is something more akin to a detective agency for supernatural cases. For those jobs, Mikiya isn`t really a secretary, but an actual investigator, and Touko hired him for his ability as one, seeing he managed to trace her to Garan no Dou even though it`s surrounded by bounded fields and nearly impossible to find. Garan no Dou`s job is so good even the Mage`s Association hires it through Touko`s connection, despite the fact Touko is actually on the run from them. She is on the run because the Mage`s Association has placed a Sealing Designation on her, which means that her skill and knowledge about a unique subject, which can`t be acquired through study (in her case, puppet making), are too strong and useful to be allowed to be lost; due to various reasons, the Designation effectively means doom for a magus. Indeed, she is so skilled that even before the Designation was placed she had already been dubbed Orange; receiving a color is one of the highest recognitions of skill in the Association. She is the sister of Tsukihime`s http://anidb.net/ch1945 [Aozaki Aoko], with whom she does not share a particularly good relationship, for reasons such as Aoko having inherited family head status and having been dubbed Blue, a more powerful color which Touko wanted, and Touko using her name to get money from the Association. She also has a role in the Heaven`s Feel route of the Fate/Stay Night game, in which
she appears as the unnamed maker of http://anidb.net/ch1904 [Emiya Shirou]`s new body, which is actually a puppet, in the True End`s epilogue, after his original body was destroyed.</description>

<description>A trans-national, self-preservative organisation created by western magi for the purpose of controlling, concealing and developing Magecraft. Founded around the Middle Ages by those who foresaw the decline of Magecraft, they decided that in order to preserve their power Thaumaturgy should drift apart from society and become a secret known only by a necessary minimum number of people.
It has many laboratories and research bodies that seek to advance the progress of Thaumaturgy, as well as institutions that transmit their secrets to the next generation. Although the emphasis lies on the pursuit of knowledge, the Association also seeks to increase its own military strength so it can defend itself against those that might threaten it, such as the Holy Church, other mystic organizations and supernatural forces seeking punish mankind for meddling with areas that should not be touched.
The Mage`s Association is currently headquartered at the Clock Tower in London.</description>

<description>The Holy Church, also referred simply as "the Church", is a worldwide religious organisation, apparently styled after the real Roman Catholic Church. It is a powerful faction in the Nasuverse, with several important characters in the `verse works being its active or former members. On the surface, they coexist rather peacefully with the http://anidb.net/ch1951 [Mage`s Association], but that is only out of necessity, and neither group will waste an opportunity to backstab the other. They sometimes act as arbiters in the Association`s internal disputes; one such example are the Holy Grail Wars. Aside their regular duties as a normal religious group, they have a few special agencies dedicated to supernatural events.
The Assembly of the Eighth Sacrament, the lowest among the Church`s special agencies, is charged with researching, recovering and managing Holy Relics, items considered to have the holy attribute, scattered around the world. Their name comes from the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church. As the Holy Grail is a Holy Relic, they`re in charge of managing every Holy Grail that appears; as such, in order to watch over the Holy Grail War, the priest stationed at Fuyuki City is always a member of this agency and is the one who acts as the war`s Supervisor.
The Church is also very active and relentless in the pursue and elimination of heretics, beings acting in disagreement with the Holy Scriptures. The members of the Church in that line of work are called Executors, and their specialties include magus hunting, demon killing, and vampire slaying. Among them, the most powerful ones are members of the Burial Agency, a group always composed of eight Executors, one of whom is the leader and another of whom is not an acting member, but a backup. Members of the Burial Agency work alone, and they will act without orders if they deem necessary, even going as far as skewering bishops, which earned them the reputation of the most heretic group inside the Church.
Among the items the Holy Church uses for its purposes, one can find the many types of Keys of Providence, Conceptual Weapons used for purification, and the Holy Scriptures, very powerful Conceptual Weapons used only by a few select Executors. Examples of Keys of Providence are http://anidb.net/ch1916 [Kotomine Kirei]`s most used weapons, the Black Keys, sword-shaped items that can be thrown at an opponent in order to pierce them and that do not have a blade when inside the priest`s frock. An example of a Holy Scripture is the Seventh Holy Scripture, used by http://anidb.net/ch1941 [Ciel], a massive metal weapon which can kill a vampire through physical power alone, shoots Bible pages, has an unicorn horn for a bayonet, and has a http://anidb.net/ch31725 [residing spirit].</description>

<description>Araya Souren is a former Buddhist monk who has lived for around 300 years and is an acquaintance of http://anidb.net/ch1887 [Aozaki Touko] from the time they studied at the Mage`s Association in London. Though he may be considered an average magus at face value, he is highly skilled in the creation of bounded fields. He carries a special bounded field that is divided into three layers, and absolutely anything that steps within range of the outer field is automatically frozen in place. It is mobile, something out of the ordinary since bounded fields are usually impossible to move, and Araya typically uses it as a weapon. Not only that, but the building that serves as his lair has become so much a part of him that it is almost like a reality marble, cementing him as an extremely powerful magus.</description>

<description>Cornelius Alba is a magus, an acquaintance of http://anidb.net/ch1887 [Aozaki Touko] from their days as students. They were on good terms until the day Cornelius came to the realisation that Touko was a better magus than he was. Even though he was popularly considered a better magus than her, he eventually became so obsessed with his inferiority that he occasionally becomes deranged when speaking of her. He joined up with http://anidb.net/ch3515 [Araya Souren] not because of the latter`s goals, but solely in order to kill Touko to prove his superiority. Though would naturally be more powerful than both Araya and Touko, he is blinded by his arrogance and is not nearly as versatile as they are.</description>

<description>The Master of Rider and future Lord El-Melloi II, Waver steals his teacher`s artifact early on and uses it to summon Rider. He plans to use the Grail to force the Magus Association to recognize his genius. Despite his difficulties with Rider`s overbearing nature, Waver and his Servant form a strong relationship. Though lacking in practical experience in the field, Waver, mostly in part due to his Servant, survives with Holy Grail War with little detriment to himself and develops a greater sense of perspective of the world.

While he holds the command spells for Lancer, the energy to materialize the Servant is maintained by Sola-Ui. He is confident in his abilities and takes pride in his heritage, but finds the extent of Kiritsugu`s untraditional and underhanded tactics both offensive and unexpectedly challenging to overcome.

He`s the father of http://anidb.net/ch35637 [Toosaka Rin] and http://anidb.net/ch35638 [Matou Sakura]. He is not particularly talented, and attempts to compensate that through training; still, his both daughters possess extremely rare talents. He is a prideful and arrogant man who keeps a good appearance and his calm at all times, believing that a magus may never fail to be elegant. He also believes in that which he calls "the path of a magus", which is a kind of noblesse oblige: he believes that the magus is a superior entity in comparison to regular humans, and as such has special, more important duties.</description>

<description>Kariya is the uncle of Shinji Matou and Master of Berserker. He is the only member of the Matou family who truly loves Sakura Matou like a daughter, and is upset that Tokiomi allowed his younger child to be adopted by Zouken. Kariya had previously left the Matou family ten years prior to the 4th Holy Grail War out of disgust for his own family, but returns and makes a deal with Zouken Matou that he will win the Grail War in exchange for Sakura`s freedom. Due to his lack of formal training, Kariya was implanted with the same magical worms as Sakura. This caused a number of side effects as the worms would literally eat away at their host, causing Kariya`s health to progressively fail in return for significantly expanding his magic circuits and magical potential. By the time of his summoning of a Servant, Kariya`s hair had turned white and the nerves on the left side of his face were dead. In addition, his natural lifespan had been shortened to such an extent that Zouken estimated he would only live on for one additional year. However, despite the Crest Worms and his own accelerated training, Kariya remained severely lacking as a Magus. At Zouken`s behest, he compensated for this by summoning the most powerful of the seven Servant classes, the Servant of Mad Enhancement, Berserker. However, the high volume of magical energy required to maintain Berserker causes him constant, excruciating pain.

<description>Assassin is actually the reincarnation of the head of the Assassin Order. While every Assassin in every Grail War thus recorded has shared the same name of Hassan-i Sabbāh, they are different persons as all the leaders of the Assassin Order changed their names to Hassan-i Sabbāh upon ascending to the position. The Hassan-i Sabbāh in the Fourth War became head by intentionally fracturing his psyche during life to confuse opponents, a form of self-inflicted dissociative identity disorder. When summoned as a Servant, this ability manifests itself as the Noble Phantasm Zabaniya: Delusional Illusion, which splits his body into up to eighty different entities, sharing his spiritual potential amongst them. They act as reconnaissance agents for Tokiomi and Kirei after Gilgamesh "kills" one of them. Assassin can only be truly defeated if all of them are killed.

Lancer possesses two Noble Phantasms: Gae Buidhe: The Golden Rose of Mortality, a short yellow spear which inflicts wounds that do not heal as long as the spear exists in the world, and Gae Dearg: The Crimson Rose of Exorcism, a long red spear which cancels mana upon contact, ignoring all magical defences and temporarily dispelling all magical attributes of the target struck.

<description>Rider`s identity is Iskander, the King of Conquerors, famous in history as Alexander the Great, who desires to defeat Saber in particular because he believes her ideals regarding kingship are delusional and that she would thrive as one of his followers. He derives his status as Rider from a set of divine bulls and chariot purportedly a gift from Zeus, known as Gordius Wheel: Wheel of Heaven`s Author, summoned when Iskander slices the air with his Sword of the Kupriotes. His eccentric and overbearing personality along with his incredible abilities creates difficulties for his Master and their opponents. He is notably the only Servant that Gilgamesh truly respects as an equal, the latter inviting him to challenge him in combat as many times as he wished. His first Noble Phantasm is Via Expugnatio: Distant Trampling Domination, the trampling attack used by the Gordius Wheel, which causes lightning strikes upon movement, inflicting massive damage to whatever is in its path. His second and most powerful Noble Phantasm is Ionioi Hetairoi: Army of the King, which is a Reality Marble, a self-contained miniature world that contains thousands of the most trusted of his soldiers who fought alongside him in life resurrected as temporary Servants, marching upon an endless plain of sand.

<description>Commonly known as Bluebeard, his real name is Gilles de Rais - a mass serial killer who seems to favour killing children in particular. Caster is a sadistic and evil Servant who derives pleasure from first providing his victims a moment of relief before terrorizing them and then killing them. He expresses an obsessive interest in Saber because he has mistaken her for Jeanne d`Arc, with whom Bluebeard has an infatuation. His sole Noble Phantasm is Prelati`s Spellbook: Text of the Sunken Spiraled City, a magical tome made from human skin which acts as a massive prana source and a guidebook for various spells of varying power, with the strongest spell capable of summoning otherworldly, self-regenerating monsters. The strength of his Noble Phantasm helps make up for his otherwise average ability in magecraft.

<charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
<description>Previously known as the Black Knight, Berserker is a Servant who possesses the ability to use practically any object as a Noble Phantasm, allowing him to match Gilgamesh in combat. His madness has reduced him to a mindless, though dangerously skilled, fighter. Despite his insanity, he is still able to instinctively recognize Saber. When Saber finally learns Berserker`s true identity, she is devastated that her decisions in life and her adherence to chivalry had caused her friend such suffering even after dying. He possesses three Noble Phantasms, the first of which is For Someone`s Glory: Not For One`s Own Glory, which envelopes him in a black fog that makes his outline blurred and his status unreadable to other Masters. By use of a Command Spell, it is possible to use the fog to allow Berserker to mimic another`s appearance, although it is noted that had Lancelot been summoned under a different Class, he would be able to freely disguise at will. Knight of Honor: A Knight Does Not Die with Empty Hands, allows him to turn anything he recognizes as a weapon, into a D- ranked Noble Phantasm. If he grabs hold of others` Noble Phantasms, he claims them temporarily as his own and their original rank is retained. His last Noble Phantasm, Arondight: The Unfading Light of the Lake is a magical sword which, when drawn, dispels For Someone`s Glory and Knight of Honour, boosts all his parameters and grants him additional prowess against beings with a `dragon` attribute such as this war`s Saber.
