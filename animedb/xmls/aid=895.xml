<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="201320">A unique drawing style, which is sadly too realistic for anime and makes most of the character designs plain ugly. The story is also very weak. I cannot recommend this to anyone, although fans of the manga might like it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="For Fans" uid="79753">I AGREE WITH SCOUTEN - FOR FANS ONLY!!!!! Despite all the good reviews for this anime, i personally did not connect with the plot and the characters (especially TANABE AI... sigh........)</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="256993">One of the very best anime i ve ever seen</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="313060">I can`t recommend this enough. It`s perfect. Are you considering watching it just from the title image? Do it.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="92088">Probably the most realistic space anime ever made, and it`s not boring at all! Really enjoyable anime.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="8855">An overall good anime. Character development is the focus but is not necessarily very realistic. What amused me the most though was that the Indian guy had a son called "Musharraf".</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="292539">Def a must watch. Great ending that will leave you satisfied.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="191784">Being a "space enthusiast" i enjoyed this anime like crazy. Nice plot. Good character development. EXCELENT setting, the ambience of "living in space" is awesome.
Watch it!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="206351">I wasn`t impressed with this anime at first (it seems very heavy handed at the beginning), but if you stick with it, it gets really good towards the end. The description might make you think it`s a boring anime about mundane things, but it has lots of subplots and things like that. This anime is lighthearted at times, comedic often, but also hits some serious notes. The characters are very likeable and generally realistic. The human element is really there in all the episodes. Definitely recommended.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Recommended" uid="378701">Quite an interesting anime, different than what I use to watch. At first I wasn`t sure whether I`d like or not but I ended up enjoying it. It`s a decent anime but that`s it, definitely not a masterpiece.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="172236">Brace for impact at first few episodes, as they are pretty weak, probably designed to ease newcomers in with too much humor. But when development is done and Planetes starts rolling... it really is amazing.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="120720">Great show for any SF fan. I was riveted, watched in one sitting!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="136978">Planetes proves that you can an anime about space without any mecha or intergalactic warfare.
While it begins as a bit light-hearted, the final episodes touch on some serious problems, both social and personal ones.
Definitely recommended to everyone looking for something thought-provoking and emotional.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="130348">space, characters, music, story, romance. nothing bad to complain. everything very good</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="281023">I simply cannot recommend it enough.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="333550">My favorite.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="78404">Very realistic setting and characters plus an overall enjoyable experience.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="335977">The characters in this series seem the most "human" than any other series I`ve seen. The first half of this series defines the motivations that drive the behavior for each character. As the series drives to it`s uncertain end, you can see the individual behaviors from each character, not pushing the story forward but contributing to the final act. Highly recommended, not for the (impressive) realism, but for the impressive characters there in.</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="490312">not much to say....almost equivalent to the great works of science fiction of Arthur Clarke or Isaac Asimov....(guys don`t get mad i said almost).anyway to all sci fi enthusiast Must See.to everyone else :watch and you become a scifi enthusiast</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="16524">The character development and facing one`s doubt in this anime truly is amazing along  with the plot line.  A MUST SEE!!!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="76992">Perfect Ending! Made my cry because of it`s awesomeness!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="403447">One word: Realistic!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="592613">Defintely a must see anime. Well it start funny, pass through drama and end with hope... love, politics, strong caracters and little action: such a good receipt!</recommendation>
<recommendation type="Must See" uid="254003">Wery nice science fiction</recommendation>

<name>seinen</name>
<description>Seinen, literally "young man", is one of the main demographic classifications applied to manga, and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.</description>

<description>A ninja was a covert agent or mercenary of feudal Japan specializing in unorthodox arts of war.
The functions of the ninja included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, and assassination, as well as open combat in certain situations.
The ninja, using covert methods of waging war, were contrasted with the samurai, who had strict rules about honor and combat.</description>

<description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate children, or children with delicate parents.</description>

<name>dynamic</name>
<description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are: 
Plot Continuity 
How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
Stereotype Characters
Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite stereotype protagonists.
Plot Twists
Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.</description>

<name>target audience</name>
<description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band; not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most likely possibility.</description>

<name>themes</name>
<description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life, Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.</description>

Is it violent Action, an awe-inspiring Adventure in a foreign place, the gripping life of a Detective, a slapstick Comedy, an Ecchi Harem anime, a SciFi epic, or some Fantasy travelling adventure?</description>

<name>future</name>
<description>Anime that fall under the future category are the ones that have a society that could have originated from ours. In most cases it should go hand to hand with sci-fi since we expect the future to consist of advanced technology, however, in the case where it`s explicitly stated in the story that the anime takes place "x years into the future", the state of technology doesn`t matter as long as it`s long into the future. The anime can be set in an alternative universe not tied with our own, as long as it has a futuristic feel to it.
This category sports quite a lot of anime, mostly stemming from SciFi, but not necessarily only from there.</description>

<name>Earth</name>
<description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien invaders.</description>

<description>Space Travel usually refers going to space or travelling there with or without a spacecraft. There are different forms of space travel like Interplanetary travel, Interstellar travel or Intergalactic travel. Since it isn`t possible to travel faster than light, most anime series involve some sort "sub-space travel mechanism" as a way to travel faster than light.</description>

<description>Power Suits are similar to Piloted Robots which are controlled from inside the robot except that Power Suits tend to be more directly tied to how the character moves and they are usually not as big as Piloted Robots can be.

<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.</description>

<description>Asia is Earth`s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers, about 30% of Earth`s total land area and 8.7% of the Earth`s total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

<name>crime</name>
<description>The underworld we talk about here is not to be confused with the place where people are believed to go after they die, but the general term for organized crime. It is a shady world, unknown to most people, where illegal things like murder, smuggling, drug dealing and similar are happening daily. Groups known to be acting in this world are for example the mafia or the yakuza.</description>

<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<description>The Special Squads are called in when the police is completely outclassed, e.g. fighting criminal syndicates. These special forces are trained to combat specific forms of crime, e.g. the anti-cyber-crime division.
There are several such squads: Whereas Section 9 of Ghost in the Shell is an official government organisation, there are also "benevolent" vigilante groups like the Knight Sabers (Bubblegum Crisis).
Criminal syndicates also have their special forces e.g. "death squads".</description>

<name>hard science fiction</name>
<description>Hard science fiction is a category of http://anidb.net/t2846 [science fiction] characterised by an emphasis on scientific accuracy, technical detail, or both. The term is not defined precisely, and is often seen as an approximate way of describing works. Stories revolving around scientific and technical consistency were written as early as 1860s and 1870s; http://anidb.net/cr5973 [Jules Verne] is generally considered the creator of the genre. Although not always accurate in his scientific depictions, and though Verne himself denied writing as a scientist or seriously predicting machines and technology of the future, the attention to detail in his work became an inspiration for many future scientists and explorers.
Nowadays, the term soft science fiction is also often used to refer to science fiction stories which lack scientific focus or rigorous adherence to known science; the categorization "hard science fiction" thus represents a position on a broad continuum ranging from "softer" to "harder". There is a degree of flexibility in how far from "real science" a story can stray before it leaves the realm of hard science fiction; some authors scrupulously avoid such technology as faster-than-light travel, while others accept such notions but focus on realistically depicting the worlds that such a technology might make possible. In this view, a story`s scientific "hardness" is less a matter of the absolute accuracy of the science content than of the rigour and consistency with which the various ideas and possibilities are worked out. Furthermore, later discoveries do not necessarily invalidate the label of hard science fiction; the designation remains valid even when a crucial plot element is later discovered to be incorrect.

<name>manly tears</name>
<description>Somewhere down the line, it became the "norm" that boys don`t cry. The scenario does not matter; shedding tears is the ultimate no-no in terms of what you can and cannot do as a man (at least in the West, anyway). But there comes a time when a man`s emotions do get the better of him, and they pour forth - as prerequisite an impassioned speech may or may not be present - by cascading down his cheeks. These are what we like to call "manly tears". Extremely powerful. Not limited but often used in hot-blooded / super robot shows. Examples include Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar, Getter Robo and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
The opposite of manly tears are "girly tears".</description>

<description>Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with Islamism or jihadism, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals

<description>Hachirota Hoshino is the protagonist of the series. Everyone simply calls him "Hachi" (Japanese for "eight" or "eighth") or "Hachimaki" (ハチマキ?), because he wears one during his EVAs. His dream has always been to own his own spaceship, but between the cost of purchasing one and his low-paying, seemingly dead-end job, Hachi struggles with even deciding whether or not to pursue his dream. Hachi`s father is a renowned engineer, a source of much ambivalence to Hachimaki. Much of Hachi`s drive is summed up in "bigger, faster, and further". However, this drive makes him conflicted about his own relationship with space.</description>

Several years before the events of the story, he and his wife were in a low-orbit craft traveling to England when a small bolt slammed into one of the ship`s windows at high velocity, causing the plane to depressurize and make an emergency landing. Many died in the highly publicized incident, including Yuri`s wife, who was never found. The incident and Yuri`s desire to recover his wife`s lost keepsake, a compass she wore around her neck, drives him to collect more debris. In the anime, Yuri and the Debris Section Office Staff are responsible for looking after the ISPV 7`s resident animals. Gigalt apparently gave Yuri a nickname, though it is never spoken within the anime.</description>
